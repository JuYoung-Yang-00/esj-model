The company, called Rockhopper, brought its claim not in Italian courts but through a system of international arbitration that allows foreign investors to sue governments. Last year, the company won the case along with an order that the Italian government pay Rockhopper about $200 million. On Thursday, a United Nations expert warned that cases like these could be the beginning of a wave of litigation that threatens to undermine climate action as nations look to phase out fossil fuel development. David Boyd, the special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, told a committee of the U.N. General Assembly that governments are being targeted with dozens of legal claims seeking hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, with many of those suits brought by oil and mining companies.

Instead of making polluters pay, states are paying polluters.” Boyd was presenting the findings of a report about a corner of international law known as investor-state dispute settlements, or ISDS, which has been enshrined by a web of some 3,000 investment treaties and trade agreements, many of which date to the 1990s. The agreements generally offer protections for foreign investors and allow them to file arbitration claims if government actions harm their interests. Corporations have filed more than 1,250 claims since the 1990s, with the number accelerating over the last decade along with a rise in foreign investment, although the true number of cases is unknown because many remain secret. Their claims are typically heard by three-member arbitration panels made up of attorneys, with each side nominating one member who, together, pick the third. Arguments are then heard behind closed doors by the arbitrators, whose awards are binding on the parties. Pakistan was ordered to pay nearly $6 billion to a joint Canadian-Chilean mining company in 2019 after declining to issue it a license. After a protracted legal battle, the parties reached a settlement last year that waived the award in exchange for allowing the mine to proceed. The Republic of the Congo is currently facing claims from three foreign mining companies seeking more than $30 billion, twice the nation’s gross domestic product. Oil, gas and mining companies have lodged more claims than any other industry, with many of the awards reaching into the billions of dollars. The 12 largest awards alone, 11 of which have gone to fossil fuel or mining companies, totaled more than $95 billion, according to Boyd’s report, a figure that “likely exceeds the total amount of damages awarded by all courts to victims of human rights violations in all States worldwide, ever.” While the system was intended to help protect companies when governments nationalize their assets, the report and many other critics of ISDS say that multinational corporations have “weaponized” these protections to challenge new environmental regulations, taxes and other policies that cut into profits. Because the majority of cases have been filed by corporations from the United States, Europe and Canada against developing nations, many advocates and academics have warned that the ISDS system could further cripple those countries’ ability to address climate change by deepening their foreign debts and constraining their ability to enact environmental protections. One study published last year in Science identified some $340 billion in potential ISDS claims from oil and gas companies if governments were to begin limiting production. The fear is that countries faced with the threat of lawsuits will either back down from restricting development or will proceed and be forced to pay sometimes crippling sums, said Kyla Tienhaara, an associate professor at the School of Environmental Studies at Queen’s University in Canada and the paper’s lead author. The United States currently faces a $15 billion claim from TC Energy, the Canadian firm behind the Keystone XL oil pipeline, after the Biden administration canceled a permit for that project. The Netherlands faces a $1.5 billion claim from the German utility RWE, which sued over the Dutch government’s plan to phase out coal by 2030. Denmark, New Zealand and France have limited their own climate policies because of the threat of ISDS claims, according to Boyd’s report, and the Spanish government told him that the system discourages countries from transitioning off fossil fuels. While it is primarily wealthy nations that have faced claims directly tied to climate action, developing nations are far more exposed. According to Tienhaara’s research, Mozambique has the highest potential liability from limiting oil and gas development, up to $31 billion, followed by Guyana and Venezuela. “Something has to be done,” Boyd said in an interview with Inside Climate News in advance of his presentation. “Governments have to take action to protect themselves from these cases and to stop this before it gets worse.” Encouraging Foreign Investment? Many industry groups insist that criticism of ISDS are overblown, arguing that national courts discriminate against foreign investors and that the system provides “neutral” forums to resolve disputes. “ISDS procedures ensure that other countries treat U.S. investors fairly,” U.S. business groups have argued, and “do not seize their property without compensation.” High profile nationalizations have taken place in Argentina, Bolivia and Venezuela, among other countries, and remain a prevailing risk for investors in the natural resources sector. Business groups also argue that ISDS protections are necessary to attract foreign investment, improving developing countries’ economies. At least one study from the U.S. International Trade Commission concluded that binding ISDS guarantees resulted in increased foreign investment in both developed and developing countries. A growing number of research studies from academics and advocacy organizations contradict that finding, indicating that there is no link between ISDS and increased foreign direct investment. Those studies point to South Africa, Brazil and India as examples of nations that have resisted or limited enmeshment in ISDS while continuing to draw investment from abroad. Meanwhile, lower- and middle-income countries have been defendants in about two-thirds of all publicly reported ISDS cases, according to the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment. Latin American countries alone have paid out over $33 billion in damages or settlements. That imbalance, coupled with the fact that the majority of claimants are from Europe and North America, has provoked allegations that ISDS promotes “economic colonialism.” Lisa Sachs, director of Columbia University’s Center on Sustainable Investment, and other critics of the system say multinationals have other options for protecting their investments, including political risk insurance. Sachs said international investment law should focus on how to drive financing into climate-friendly sectors rather than perpetuating a system that is being used to protect the economic interests of fossil fuel companies. Critics have identified a host of problems with the system beyond its impact on environmental protections, including that it prioritizes the economic rights of companies over human rights of local communities. Others say ISDS lacks transparency and that protections are based on vague standards like “fair and equitable treatment” that lead to inconsistent outcomes and give private arbitrators sway over public policy. ISDS cases have been lucrative for law firms, which have begun advising clients on how to preemptively structure themselves to take advantage of the ISDS system. The U.S. law firm Jones Day, for instance, issued a client newsletter in 2022 advising fossil fuel companies to review their operations to ensure they had access to ISDS protections: “Such restructuring should take place before any climate-related dispute with the State has arisen or is reasonably foreseeable,” the newsletter said. Withdrawal and Reform Wealthy countries have recently begun shielding themselves from ISDS. Within the United States, calls to remove ISDS from free trade agreements have found common cause on both sides of the political spectrum. In renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Trump administration dropped ISDS between the United States and Canada based in part upon the belief that the system infringes on U.S. sovereignty and encourages American companies to invest, and move jobs, abroad. On the left, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has long argued against international arbitration. Like the United States, European countries have taken steps to protect themselves, with many withdrawing from the Energy Charter Treaty, a 90s-era multilateral free trade agreement aimed at promoting investment in energy development. The Energy Charter Treaty has spawned billions of dollars in ISDS claims over governments’ decisions to phase out fossil fuels. So far, Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland have either withdrawn or given notice of their intended withdrawal from the treaty, which has been widely maligned as incompatible with global climate goals. ICN provides award-winning climate coverage free of charge and advertising. We rely on donations from readers like you to keep going. And yet, these wealthy nations generally have not withdrawn from treaties with poorer nations that tend to benefit corporations headquartered in the Global North. “The inequality, injustice and hypocrisy are staggering,” Boyd’s report said. At the U.N. hearing, representatives of the United States and European Union said little about the report beyond stressing that they are already leading efforts to reform the ISDS system within the World Bank and U.N. agencies that handle trade and investment disputes. Those efforts, which have dragged on for years, have mostly focused on adjusting the procedural mechanisms of ISDS, such as creating a permanent pathway for governments to bring counterclaims. Some newer investment treaties have included provisions that aim to exempt climate, environmental and other regulations from ISDS exposure. But Boyd and many other critics of ISDS have argued that the system is so inherently flawed that the only option is to eliminate it altogether. Developing nations, Boyd told the delegates, “should form a collective effort to tear up these existing agreements between those states, and in particular beginning with the European Union, Canada and the United States,” he said. “Because how can those wealthy northern nations object to having the same basic system for developing states when they won’t accept it themselves.” Correction: This article has been updated after an earlier version gave the wrong country involved in an investor-state dispute settlement with three foreign mining companies.

Using international arbitration allowed under investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) systems, Rockhopper sued for hundreds of millions of dollars and won approximately $200 million from the Italian government. This case has been highlighted by David Boyd, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, as potentially the start of a trend where such legal mechanisms may impede climate action. Boyd spoke to the U.N. General Assembly, pointing out the numerous legal claims made against governments by oil and mining companies demanding vast sums which could have serious implications on environmental efforts. \n ISDS is enshrined in about 3,000 international treaties, enabling corporations to sue governments if actions taken by these governments harm their interests. More than 1,250 claims have been filed since the 1990s, often resulting in multi-billion dollar settlements, with a particular acceleration in the past decade. Cases are heard by three-member arbitration panels in proceedings that are not public, and the awards are binding. \n Countries like Pakistan and the Republic of the Congo have faced significant claims, and sectors such as oil, gas, and mining have been particularly active in lodging these. Critics argue that ISDS has been 'weaponized' by corporations to challenge new environmental regulations, undermining national efforts to address climate change. Developing countries are especially vulnerable, facing lawsuits that can exceed their GDP, potentially locking them into fossil fuel dependency. \n There is a significant debate over whether ISDS systems actually encourage foreign investment. While some industry groups argue that these mechanisms ensure fair treatment of U.S. investors overseas, studies indicate no link between ISDS and increased foreign direct investment. Critics like Lisa Sachs from Columbia University's Center on Sustainable Investment suggest that international investment law should instead focus on supporting climate-friendly sectors. \n Recently, some wealthy nations have taken steps to withdraw from or reform ISDS mechanisms, like the United States and several European countries exiting the Energy Charter Treaty. These countries, however, often maintain treaties that benefit their corporations in the Global North. Boyd has urged a collective effort by developing nations to terminate these treaties, especially with wealthier nations who are unwilling to accept ISDS systems themselves.\",\"date\": \"Sat, 21 Oct 2023\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/insideclimatenews.org\/news\/21102023\/un-protests-isds-as-economic-colonialism\/\",\"source\": \"climatenews\",\"title\": \"UN Expert: Obscure Legal Battles Risk Stalling Global Climate Efforts\"}"}]}

He was looking at an array of 15,000-year-old shell beads and other artifacts, which have been displayed in a case at Jerusalem’s Rockefeller Archaeological Museum since before World War II. Many people had viewed them, but Davin was struck by this detail. “If you look at it, it’s like blood, a really vivid red,” he says, “and I had to wonder, ‘What’s that color?’” Countless prehistoric artifacts are colored red with ochre, a mineral product that was the world’s first red paint, but something made this hue look very different—and Davin set out to discover what it was. Analysis with high-tech spectroscopy techniques revealed a novel source behind Davin’s suspicions. The beads, originally found in Kebara Cave, on Israel’s Mount Carmel, are the oldest known example of humans using plants to manufacture red pigment. The bright red color adorning them was produced from the roots of Rubiaceae plants, commonly known as the madder family, according to research published Wednesday in PLOS One. The creators of this 15,000-year-old paint were part of the Natufian culture. They were the first hunter-gatherers to start settling down to more sedentary lifestyles across the Levant, in what is now Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian territories. They utilized wild plants for much more than food, including processing them to make pigment, before they domesticated them. The ornamental use of these organic dyes may be an example of a growing need for expression as human societies gradually shifted over the centuries. “You try to look at your environment differently, and you have time to look at it differently, so probably over a long period of time they were looking at things like plants and animals differently and learning a lot,” says Davin, an archaeologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at a prehistoric technology laboratory at the French National Center for Scientific Research. The shell beads originated in the Mediterranean Sea—some from just 10 miles away from Mount Carmel, and some from much farther afield in the Red Sea, around 250 miles away. But many of the beads from Kebara Cave are now located even further away. British archaeologists first undertook excavations at the site in the 1930s and sent many artifacts to museum collections around the world. Previously, the earliest known examples of plant-based red pigment had appeared around 6,000 years ago. But humans—and our relatives—have long expressed ourselves with the color red, which appears to have psychological impacts on the human mind. Our ancestors produced pigments from rocks and minerals like iron oxide (which is contained in red ochre) and used them to color everything from stones and bones to cave walls—with first uses documented in Africa as far back as 500,000 years ago. Shell tooth and bone ornaments in Kebara Cave were also colored with ochre. Blocks of it were found at the cave, along with ochre-adorned artifacts such as beads and burial textiles, making it clear that this older color was still very commonly used. Davin and colleagues unearthed the pigment’s plant origins by performing several analyses. Advanced scanning studies showed no iron in the pigment, ruling out an ochre source, but showed a high carbon content that instead pointed to an organic origin. To narrow down exactly what that was, the team then used Raman spectroscopy, a chemical analysis that observes how a substance scatters light, to characterize its molecular composition. The Raman spectroscopy patterns produced by the dye were the same across all ten beads, and among possible candidate species they most closely matched signatures from compounds isolated from roots of plants from the Rubiaceae family—already known from prehistoric pollen analysis to have grown at Mount Carmel during the end of the Pleistocene period. The Natufians’ exact recipe for producing the pigment isn’t known, and Davin and his team hope to try their hand at reproducing similar substances with ancient techniques. They theorize that the Natufians dug up plants, cleaned and dried their roots, crushed them, and boiled them in water to dissolve the dye, which was then fermented. Their use of madder was a very good choice, and one that was often repeated later in history because of the outstanding color that can be produced by its roots. Red pigments made with madder have been found in King Tut’s tomb, on the Shroud of Turin and in the paintings of Vincent van Gogh. This red was a go-to up until organics were largely replaced by synthetic pigments in the 19th century. The transition from hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled agriculture wasn’t a sudden change but a long and gradual process that began with more intensive plant gathering as early as 23,000 years ago. Wild plants were also exploited and cultivated for thousands of years before they became fully domesticated and thus dependent on humans. The production of pigments is another example of how the relationships between people and plants changed, and became more intertwined, during that period. Natufian culture foragers living between 11,650 and 15,000 years ago were in the late stages of a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and extensively harvesting wild cereal plants for food. Previous research has shown that hunter-gatherers and early agriculturalists also used plants as key sources for making clothing, baskets, string and ornaments. Some of the earliest cultivar plants, like flax, were likely used primarily to make clothes. While non-food plant use was likely widespread, the hard evidence for it remains relatively scarce. Plant products and organic materials simply haven’t stood the test of time, fading away after so many thousands of years. “People weren’t just hunting animals and eating raw meat. They really were already knowing very well what plants could do and what they could use them for,” says Tobias Richter, an archaeologist at the University of Copenhagen who was not involved in the new study. Richter believes that we probably underestimate Stone Age humans’ knowledge of how to use their landscape. “I think these people were absolute experts in knowing what to do with plants,” he says. Hundreds of artifacts from Kebara Cave, including bone pendants, teeth, beads and more, were sent to museums across the United Kingdom and North America. Almost all of them, like artifacts from many other sites, have never been analyzed to see what types of plant- or animal-based pigments and dyes they might display. Using such techniques to delve into their origins could reveal much more about early relationships between humans and other species. Davin also hopes that future research will shed further light on the domestication of plants. Tools from the Kebara Cave could hold residues from processing plants, and that residue could yield genetic material. With enough samples, scientists could analyze the ancient genome and compare it to modern plants to trace the history of madder plant domestication. Beyond these species’ longstanding role as a source of pigment, their stems and leaves are still prized in the region, including in neighboring Jordan, for their antioxidant, antibacterial and even aphrodisiac qualities. To Richter, the plant-based pigments are another clear example that humans were using their imaginations to explore the resources available to them, and then used those resources creatively to elaborate their own ornamentations and rituals. “I think we tend to imagine the Stone Age past to be sort of bleak and rough and difficult to survive,” he says. “But it was also a lot more colorful and a lot more diverse than I think we often give it credit for.” Get the latest Science stories in your inbox. \nBrian Handwerk\n| READ MORE\n Brian Handwerk is a science correspondent based in Amherst, New Hampshire.\",\"date\": \"Wed, 25 Oct 2023 00:00:00 GMT\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/science-nature\/the-worlds-oldest-known-organic-paint-was-red-180983132\/\",\"source\": \"smithsonianmag\", \"title\": \"Archaeologists Find the First Red Paint Made From Plants\"}"},{"role": "assistant", "content": " {\"_id\": \"653eb9c5db4cb73d3b092206\",\"author\": \"Brian Handwerk\",\"category\": \"nature\",\"mainpoint\": [\"Laurent Davin's discovery of plant-based red pigment on shell beads points to the earliest known use of organic materials for manufacturing paint by the Natufian culture 15,000 years ago.\",\"The Natufian society, transitioning from hunter-gatherers to a more sedentary lifestyle, had an intricate knowledge of plants which they used for ornamental and possibly ritualistic purposes.\",\"This research highlights the importance of non-food plant use in prehistoric times and suggests that our Stone Age ancestors' expertise and creativity with natural resources have been historically underestimated.\"],\"summary\": \"Laurent Davin, a researcher, observed an unusually vivid red color on 15,000-year-old shell beads displayed in Jerusalem's Rockefeller Archaeological Museum that prompted him to investigate further.

Now, a second, updated report shows that many amphibians are still in trouble, but with some silver linings, researchers report October 4 in Nature. “We are realistic and hopeful at the same time,” says Jennifer Luedtke, a conservationist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which tracks extinction risk trends for species around the world. In particular, the wealth of data in the new report, which includes about 8,000 amphibian species, could help focus conservation efforts for years to come, says Luedtke, who also works from Washington, D.C., for Re:wild, a conservation organization based in Austin, Texas. That’s what happened after the first Global Amphibian Assessment in 2004, which brought awareness to the amphibian crisis and galvanized researchers to coordinate efforts. Having two assessments that can be compared is a big deal, experts say. “It’s important not just to have a picture, but actually to have a sequence of pictures … where you can see what’s happening over time,” says conservation ecologist Ana Rodrigues of CNRS in Montpelier, France, who worked on the first assessment but was not involved in the second. “I’m really happy to see this done.” Here are five big takeaways from the new report. About 41 percent of amphibian species, which include frogs, toads and salamanders, are threatened with extinction, Luedtke and her colleagues found. That’s more than any other group of vertebrates, beating out sharks and rays (37 percent), mammals (27 percent), reptiles (21 percent) and birds (13 percent). Amphibians held this title in 2004 too, when 39 percent of species were threatened. As part of the 2022 update, researchers also used data to reconstruct the situation in 1980. They found that even in 1980, that number was already high, at 38 percent. Basically, amphibians have been really threatened for a really long time, Luedtke says. The most common threat that affects amphibians is habitat loss and degradation, with agriculture affecting as many as 77 percent of the studied species. Other threats include climate change and disease, each affecting 29 percent of species. Of course, “these things are never completely isolated,” says Rodrigues, and each threat may increase the likelihood of other threats. Luedtke and colleagues also wanted to know which threats were most responsible for driving the worst declines. So they looked at a subset of 482 species that, from 1980 and 2004, moved down an IUCN Red List status level — for instance, from vulnerable to endangered. They found that disease was the primary driver behind the drop in conservation status for 58 percent of that species subset. At the time, the fungal pathogen chytrid was devastating frog populations around the world (SN: 8\/23\/02). Climate change, on the other hand, was a significant contributor to declines in only 1 percent of species. Now, less than 20 years later, climate change is behind a status drop for 39 percent of species, according to an analysis of 306 species whose status declined from 2004 to 2022. That makes it the most common primary driver of declines across the amphibian group, the researchers found. And still the finding is probably an underestimate, Luedtke says, as studies continue to emerge detailing how climate change–related temperature increases, changes in precipitation, extreme weather events and wildfires impact amphibians. “It’s very worrying,” Rodrigues says. “We’re at the beginning of climate change.… What’s ahead of us?” Each region faces its own set of threats. The chytrid outbreak, for example, has affected much of the world, but it hit Central and South America especially hard from the 1970s to the 2000s. That likely explains why that region contains the largest proportion of species in the IUCN Red List categories of highest concern, the researchers say. New Guinea and Africa were spared much of the devastation, though the pathogen has recently started to emerge in sub-Saharan Africa. Across Europe and East Asia, habitat loss is the leading cause of decline, followed by a newly emerging fungal pathogen in Europe called Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, this time that affects salamanders (SN: 9\/3\/13). It hasn’t yet spread to North America, which would be disastrous, Rodrigues says. The continent is home to more than 200 types of salamanders, over a quarter of the world’s salamander species. For now, North America’s amphibian declines are most associated with climate change, the report found. South and Southeast Asia are seeing an improving trend among their species’ extinction risk, probably due to better management of protected areas. One of the assessment’s few bright spots is its sheer amount of data. The update includes more than 2,000 additional species — all newly described since 2004. There was also a decrease in species labeled as “data deficient” by the IUCN, from 23 percent in 2004 to only 11 percent in 2022. By comparison, though, less than 1 percent of bird species are listed as data deficient. While there’s still a long way to go for amphibians, researchers are thrilled by the new amount of information. “It’s like, wow, all the knowledge!” Rodrigues says. “So that’s absolutely good news.” With more data, she says, conservation efforts can be better focused. The new report didn’t just find declines — 120 species saw their IUCN conservation status improve. About half of those species recovered unaided. Many of those had suffered declines due to chytrid and are now bouncing back, possibly as frogs become resistant to the pathogen (SN: 3\/29\/18). It’s a source of hope that “we have these little frogs evolving, in front of our eyes, resistance to chytridiomycosis,” Luedtke says. The other half improved thanks to conservation efforts, the report found. One of those species is India’s indigo bush frog (Raorchestes indigo), which was classified as critically endangered in 2004. A couple years later, a legal battle led to the end of all mining in the Kudremukh Massif mountain range, and the species’ IUCN status has since improved to vulnerable. Stories like that are evidence that effective habitat protection can make a noticeable difference, the researchers say, and yet, with most amphibians still facing declines, it’s clear that current efforts are not enough. The assessment’s accompanying State of the World’s Amphibians Report focuses on action steps based on the new findings. Among other things, it identifies 50 target conservation areas around the world — including Jamaica, Brazil’s Atlantic Forest and the Central Annamite Highlands in Vietnam — that feature a high density of threatened species. “Yes, the number of threatened amphibians continues to increase, but our understanding is improving,” Luedtke says. “And because we understand them better, we can act in a more accurate and effective way.”\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 13:00:00 GMT\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/amphibian-frog-extinction-risk-climate-global-report\", \"source\": \"sciencenews\",\"title\": \"A global report finds amphibians are still in peril.

Jennifer Luedtke, a conservationist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), highlights the mixed findings of the assessment, which now includes about 8,000 amphibian species. While the number of species at risk remains high, the comprehensive data amassed provides critical insight for conservation efforts. \n The report reveals that amphibians have been highly threatened for decades, with habitat loss and degradation being the most prevalent threats, impacting 77% of species. Climate change and disease are also significant threats, affecting 29% of species each. The latter, particularly the fungal pathogen chytrid, has been the primary driver for the decline in conservation status for a significant number of species. Alarmingly, climate change has become the most common primary driver for declines in recent years, indicating a worrying trend as global temperatures rise. \n Geographical variances in threats are notable. Central and South America suffered severely from the chytrid outbreak, whereas New Guinea and Africa were less affected. In Europe and East Asia, habitat loss and a new fungal pathogen are the leading causes of amphibian decline. North America's primary concern is climate change, whereas South and Southeast Asia show improving trends due to better management of protected areas. \n A positive development from the assessment is the decrease in 'data deficient' species, dropping from 23% to 11% since 2004, thanks to the addition of more than 2,000 newly described species. The researchers see this improvement in data as a vital step towards more effective conservation strategies. \n Some species have shown resilience; 120 species have seen their IUCN conservation status improve, half of which recovered without human intervention, possibly developing resistance to chytridiomycosis. The other half benefited from direct conservation actions, such as the indigo bush frog in India, whose status improved following a legal ban on mining in its habitat. \n Despite these successes, the general decline in amphibian populations signals that current conservation efforts are insufficient. The assessment's State of the World’s Amphibians Report outlines necessary actions, identifying 50 key conservation areas worldwide with a high density of threatened species. While the situation remains critical, the growing knowledge and identification of specific conservation targets offer some hope for the future of amphibian conservation.\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/amphibian-frog-extinction-risk-climate-global-report\",\"source\": \"sciencenews\",\"title\": \"Amphibians at Risk: Signs of Hope Amidst Decline\"}"}]}
