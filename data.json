If it passes, Question 3 on the Nov. 7 Maine ballot will tee up the sale of the current utilities’ electric transmission and distribution systems to a new company called Pine Tree Power. It would have an explicit mandate to help Maine meet its climate goals and would be partly governed by a publicly elected board. How an electric utility is owned—whether it’s by shareholders or the public—may not be the single most important factor in the energy transition, experts say, but it can have a big effect on public trust and regulatory accountability. Both are seen as key to a speedy, equitable transition to cleaner energy. We deliver climate news to your inbox like nobody else.

These issues have been at the heart of Maine’s fiery debate over the creation of Pine Tree Power. The proposed company would be the country’s first statewide consumer-owned utility created by a public vote. It would be similar to municipal power companies or cooperatives that serve about a quarter of Americans. Proponents describe Pine Tree Power as a locally-led alternative to the high rates, poor reliability and customer service issues that have plagued the state’s incumbent utilities in recent years. Central Maine Power, or CMP, the larger of the two, is owned by Connecticut-based Avangrid and, in turn, energy giant Iberdrola of Spain. The smaller Versant Power is owned by Enmax and the Canadian city of Calgary. National environmental groups like 350 and the Sierra Club have endorsed Maine’s Question 3 as a big but necessary leap away from these for-profit corporations and into a new way of creating a climate-ready power grid—a model they hope other states will follow if it succeeds in Maine. Campaign groups solely funded by CMP and Versant’s parent companies have poured more than $24 million into political ads and mailers opposing Question 3, outspending supporters nearly 30 to 1. They claim that years of litigation could follow Pine Tree Power’s approval, delaying climate progress. “When we should be investing in the grid, and we should be integrating renewables… we’re going to be fighting in court,” said David Littell, an attorney representing Versant Power. “If the bank shows up and says they’re going to take your house… you’re not going to put solar panels on your house.” The utilities have also stressed uncertainty on the costs of the buyout, including on their own potential sale price and the ensuing public debt the new utility would take on at its outset. Economic analyses suggest that the utilities’ sale price may determine whether rates will rise in the early years of Pine Tree Power. Even then, these analyses say rates would be expected to fall in the long term—largely because the new utility would be required to charge customers only for the “cost of service,” collecting a far lower rate of return on its investments as compared to an investor-owned utility. Seth Berry, a former Democratic state representative, authored the original Pine Tree Power proposal that passed the Maine legislature in 2021 before it was vetoed by Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat. At a gathering of climate activists in Winslow, Maine, in August, Berry said grid upgrades needed to meet the challenges of climate change will be inherently cheaper and easier under a utility that isn’t entitled to make a profit. “The menu of options doesn’t include ‘let’s write a bigger check to our overseas shareholders.’ You take that off the table, and you can really focus on what counts here in Maine,” Berry said. “Where we do all depend on the grid, those bread-and-butter things like rates and reliability really matter.” Maine’s Office of the Public Advocate, which acts as an ombudsman for residential utility customers, has not taken a position on the Pine Tree Power proposal. In a recent fact sheet, they said it’s possible the new utility could be more aggressive on climate change, or could be “constrained” by political pressure to avoid climate-friendly investments that could increase costs for customers. Rachel Gold leads work on business model reform in the carbon-free electricity program at RMI, formerly known as the Rocky Mountain Institute, a clean energy think tank. She said public trust in more “basic” parts of electricity service, such as costs, outages and billing, can create more “social license” for utilities and states to forge ahead on climate solutions. “We need to do decarbonization in a way that is equitable and affordable and maintains reliability,” Gold said. “In the case of Maine, that’s a place where poor performance on some of those metrics may have implications for the speed of decarbonization.” Maine’s fraught relationship with its current utilities has already had ramifications for that effort. In recent years, CMP faced investigation and a $10 million fine for mismanaging customer bills, and strong public pushback to a transmission line it proposed to bring Canadian hydropower onto the New England grid. About 60 percent of Mainers voted to try to block the project in 2021. The state Supreme Court ultimately ruled that construction could proceed—but the broader law that the voter initiative enacted will create new hurdles for future, similar power line projects. On the whole, Maine has made strong progress on building renewable energy. Wind, solar and hydropower make up more than half the generation in the state, which has a goal of 80 percent renewable electricity by 2030. Maine is pursuing offshore wind and pushing hard to switch homes and businesses from oil to heat pumps. As in many states, Maine’s electric system was restructured more than 20 years ago to prevent the utilities that own transmission and distribution infrastructure, like poles and wires, from also owning power plants and other generation assets. But Gold said any transmission utility, regardless of its ownership structure, still must invest and innovate to encourage more renewables and create a transformed power grid. “If a utility defaults to how it’s been doing business forever, it may not select the cheapest option,” she said. “If you don’t … do that planning well, you’re probably going to undervalue many of the best options for decarbonization.” Maine’s incumbent electricity providers have seen these challenges firsthand in recent years. The state legislature passed generous incentives for solar projects in 2019, leading to a glut of solar proposals that continue to clog the queue to get connected to the grid. Developers have complained of long delays, poor communication and unpredictable, often prohibitively high prices charged by CMP and Versant as the utilities have assessed the infrastructure upgrades required to get projects online. CMP has acknowledged in regulatory filings that it was not prepared to implement the new solar program, which was scaled back by the legislature earlier this year in an effort to curb the development backlog and reduce costs passed on to customers. The utility had previously lobbied against other, similar incentives. Maine environmental groups working on these issues have been split on the Pine Tree Power plan. Some have agreed that the status quo is problematic but questioned whether a shift to public power will help. The Natural Resources Council of Maine came out in favor of the initiative earlier this month. “Weighing the pros and cons of shifting to public power in Maine is an exercise in comparing two unknown futures,” it stated. “But business as usual will probably be… business as usual.” Johannah Blackman is executive director of the nonprofit A Climate To Thrive on Mount Desert Island, Maine, the home of Acadia National Park. She said her group chose to support Pine Tree Power after struggling to work with Versant Power on a planned community solar array that ultimately fell through. “What we’re seeing from Versant is a lot of explaining as to, or justification of why, they can’t really get solar well interconnected,” Blackman said, “but not any kind of foresight or planning into how they’re going to solve that.” Versant spokeswoman Judy Long said the utility has successfully hooked up many other solar projects on Mount Desert Island and across their territory, and that the one project Blackman referenced was stalled by factors like changing regulations and an increasingly crowded interconnection queue. “The distribution system was not originally built to accommodate limitless exports of energy,” Long said. “Nonetheless, we know that the grid of the future will look much different and we’re working to ensure it’s built in a way that is cost-effective, efficient and reliable.” Richard Sedano leads the Regulatory Assistance Project, a global consulting firm that advises public agencies on energy issues. He said states like Maine have seen an erosion of trust and collaboration in their energy regulatory systems, and he argued that Pine Tree Power alone won’t solve that. “The notion of a silver bullet is a fantasy in just about every regulatory matter,” Sedano said. “What does matter is good governance… that has the public interest squarely in the center of the picture.” That requires more time and resources, better utility data transparency and strong stakeholder engagement at a state’s Public Utilities Commission, he said. Sedano and RMI’s Gold also suggested a politically easier alternative to a change like Pine Tree Power: performance-based regulation, which seeks “to reduce perverse incentives and reward utilities for reaching the performance targets you care about,” said Gold.

Mills, Maine’s Democratic governor, spearheaded a state law last year that Gold said has some elements of this approach. The law sets new performance standards for electric utilities and will require 10-year plans for addressing climate impacts on the grid every three years beginning this December. The law also included a path to potentially replacing the companies if they consistently fall short. In a recent radio address urging Mainers to vote against Pine Tree Power, Mills pointed to this law as a sign of progress. But for the proposed utility’s supporters, like Blackman of A Climate to Thrive, a public power model is the best way to align utilities’ motivations with customers’ needs and create the grid of the future. “I don’t think the accountability measures are anywhere near enough if the utilities are still going to, first and foremost, be accountable to their investors,” said Blackman. “It’s not a framework that’s set up for climate goals. And if there were a way to make it work, I think we would have gotten there by now.”\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 09:00:00 GMT\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/insideclimatenews.org\/news\/27102023\/mainers-ballot-initiative-create-statewide-nonprofit-electric-utility\/\",\"source\": \"climatenews\",\"title\": \"Mainers See Climate Promise in Ballot Initiative to Create a Statewide Nonprofit Electric Utility\"}"},

This nonprofit utility, intended to replace the state’s current investor-owned electric companies, is poised to be a groundbreaking step towards achieving Maine's climate objectives. \n Pine Tree Power is conceived as a solution to the high rates, reliability issues, and customer service complaints associated with Central Maine Power (CMP) and Versant Power. CMP, owned by Avangrid and the Spanish energy conglomerate Iberdrola, and Versant, owned by Enmax and the Canadian city of Calgary, have faced significant criticism for their management and approach towards the state's renewable energy transition. The new utility, featuring a governance model that includes a publicly elected board, is projected to accelerate Maine's move to cleaner energy sources, driven by its mandate to focus solely on service costs rather than profits. \n The initiative has received backing from prominent environmental groups such as 350 and the Sierra Club, which see it as an innovative path to a climate-resilient power grid. However, it faces staunch opposition from the incumbent utilities, whose parent companies have invested over $24 million in anti-Question 3 campaigns. These campaigns highlight potential legal battles and delays in climate action that could stem from the transition to Pine Tree Power. \n Notably, Seth Berry, a former Democratic state representative, has been a key proponent of the initiative, emphasizing the advantages of a nonprofit utility model in achieving cost-effective and reliable grid upgrades essential for combating climate change. His stance is that removing the profit element allows for a concentrated effort on what benefits Maine directly. \n Despite the enthusiasm, there are warnings of political pressures that might hinder the new utility's climate commitments. The state's Office of the Public Advocate has remained neutral, suggesting that while there is potential for more aggressive climate action, political influences could also constrain investments. \n Rachel Gold from RMI highlights the necessity for public trust in utilities as a foundation for advancing climate solutions. Maine's contentious interactions with CMP and Versant, including a $10 million fine for CMP over customer billing issues and pushback against a transmission line project, underscore the need for a reliable utility focused on equitable and affordable decarbonization. \n While the state has made substantial progress in renewable energy, with more than half its energy coming from renewable sources and aims to reach 80% by 2030, the shift to public power remains controversial. The Natural Resources Council of Maine supports the change, while others remain skeptical, weighing potential benefits against uncertainties. \n Ultimately, Maine's debate over Pine Tree Power is not just about an energy provider but reflects broader issues of regulatory trust, governance, and the efficacy of climate action. Whether Maine will forge ahead with this new model or continue under existing utility structures will be a decision with implications for the state’s energy future and could set a precedent for nationwide utility reforms.\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/insideclimatenews.org\/news\/27102023\/mainers-ballot-initiative-create-statewide-nonprofit-electric-utility\/\",\"source\": \"climatenews\",\"title\": \"Maine Ballot Initiative Proposes Nonprofit Electric Utility for Climate Gain\"}"}

        {"role": "user", "content": "{\"_id\": \"653eb764db4cb73d3b0921e3\",\"author\": \"Bob Berwyn\",\"category\": \"politics\",\"content\": \"From our collaborating partner “Living on Earth,” public radio’s environmental news magazine, an interview by Managing Producer Jenni Doering with Bob Berwyn of  Inside Climate News. Wealthy nations agreed at the annual U.N. climate conference last year, COP27, to pay low-income countries for some of the “loss and damage” caused by the climate crisis. It’s a huge toll and growing. According to a May 2023 report from the World Meteorological Organization, extreme weather and climate-related events over the last 50 years caused a whopping $4.3 trillion in economic losses worldwide. Even just one disaster can wipe out a small nation’s financial reserves. That’s what happened in the small Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, which in 2020 suffered a cyclone that caused $600 million in damage, some 60 percent of its GDP. And as temperatures and sea levels rise in the coming decades, those kinds of losses are expected to keep rising too. But coming to an agreement about exactly how the new loss and damage fund should work is a bone of contention between the rich and poor nations, even as the next big climate talks this December in Dubai, COP28, rapidly approach. Bob Berwyn, a journalist with Inside Climate News, is here to give us some insight. JENNI DOERING: Welcome to Living on Earth, Bob! BOB BERWYN: It’s great to be here again. Thanks for having me. DOERING: So what are the challenges the U.N. is facing when it comes to following through on the loss and damage commitments made last year. BERWYN: The challenges are many. There are some serious rifts between developed countries and developing countries as to where the loss and damage fund should be hosted. They’re running out of time with COP28 coming up. They had set a timetable to finalize a set of recommendations for this loss and damage fund in time for approval at COP28. And so they held a series of meetings over the last eight months or so. And they weren’t able to finalize those recommendations. So they added a fifth meeting of this transitional committee, as it’s called, for early November, to make one more effort to finalize the set of recommendations. The recommendations will include things like which countries should pay into the fund, which countries will be eligible to receive loss and damage payments, how the board of directors will be set up and again, importantly, where this fund will be hosted. Will it be hosted under the World Bank, as developed countries suggest? Or will it be sort of a more independent financial institution associated with the United Nations?

Don’t miss a beat. Get a daily email of our original, groundbreaking stories written by our national network of award-winning reporters. DOERING: So tell me more about that. Why is there such a big rift over where to host this, whether at the World Bank or somewhere else? BERWYN: Right, in some ways, it seems a technicality. But it also gets to the core of some of the issues reflecting the larger global climate negotiations. And that’s the issue of financial and economic equity and environmental justice globally. So on the one side, you have a huge bloc of countries that are known as the G77, which is 135 countries. That includes about 80 percent of the world’s population. A lot of those countries don’t necessarily trust the World Bank. They see it as something that represents exploitation on the part of the developed world. And they would rather see the loss and damage fund as an independent instrument; they would rather see this new financial institution be more independent. A handful of the developed countries represented in these transitional negotiations, the U.S., France and Australia, seem to be really insistent that this should be a World Bank operation, with the justification that the World Bank already knows how to do this. It has mechanisms in place to receive money, to pay out money, and so forth. It would be sort of streamlined. DOERING: So with these 135 countries, or 80 percent of the world’s population, as you say, represented in terms of the countries that want to host this as an independent fund. That’s a pretty significant majority. But I guess that’s not how the U.N. works, I gather. BERWYN: It is not how the U.N. works, especially the U.N. climate process, the UNFCCC, which is truly based on consensus and on voluntary actions and agreements. You know, there’s nothing in the Paris Climate Agreement, nothing really in the United Nations Climate framework that is binding or mandatory or associated with any sort of sanctions for not doing what you said you were gonna do. And you could see that as a weakness. You could also see it as a strength that allows countries to do what they can at any given time, acknowledging that political winds shift and change. Alliances change. And it’s a flexible enough process to withstand some of these things. DOERING:  Now, how much money might this loss and damage fund eventually include? BERWYN: It wasn’t discussed in detail at this last meeting that I followed closely, but there is one written document submitted by the developing countries bloc that mentions $100 billion by 2030, for starters. And then there’s outside independent research by climate economists and experts who are estimating loss and damage costs of up to $500 billion by 2050. DOERING: How far back in the U.N. climate process does this idea of loss and damage go? BERWYN: I think it goes back to the very beginning of the U.N. climate process when the Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted in 1992. And there’s language in the original charter that addresses the fact that there are some countries that are feeling the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, but don’t actually emit very many greenhouse gases themselves. And that there’s another group of countries that have emitted a huge, huge, vast majority of the greenhouse gas emissions during the Industrial Age. And that disparity needs to be addressed by some process. You’re not going to have a lasting sustainable climate solution until these things are addressed. They really kind of go hand in hand. DOERING: And some would say that the fossil fuel companies themselves, which have been extracting this stuff, and selling it for decades now, would also be responsible. To what extent does that play into these loss and damage discussions at all? BERWYN: It does play into it, because there were discussions about where’s this money going to come from. But I think it’s important to note that, in some cases, countries that influence the climate negotiations and fossil fuel companies are almost one and the same thing. I mean, if you look at Saudi Arabia, you know, and Aramco, the state owned oil company. Or Norway is another example, you know, where the state is involved heavily in extracting fossil fuels. So you can’t always distinguish between the states and the fossil industry. And I think that’s part of the problem that some individual states basically represent fossil fuel companies’ interests at these talks. DOERING: Hmm, that’s a really good point. And, for that matter, I mean, the United Arab Emirates itself, which is hosting this COP in December… BERWYN: Right. DOERING: …that’s been a matter of great concern for some people watching this process. ICN provides award-winning climate coverage free of charge and advertising. We rely on donations from readers like you to keep going. BERWYN: That has been a matter of great concern. It’s going to be hard for some countries to trust and believe anything regarding a commitment to reduce fossil fuel use from a company in a country that depends on that fossil fuel production for its economy. DOERING: What’s next for loss and damage? BERWYN: So this transitional committee that was established at COP27, or after COP27, is going to meet one more time from Nov. 3 to 5. And they will try to finalize a set of recommendations for this loss and damage fund. Depending on what shape or form that takes, it will then be presented to COP28 to the plenary, the full assembly of all 196 countries there, to be debated and voted on. Even if the loss and damage transitional committee is not able to finalize a set of recommendations in early November, I think COP28 is going to have to deal with this in one way or another. This is a test of, can the COP process deliver on some of its big promises that it seems to make from time to time? You know, two years ago there was a pledge to halt global deforestation. Well, guess what? Global deforestation is still increasing. Then there was a pledge to cut methane emissions 30 percent by 2030. Guess what? Methane took another record jump this year. Last year, there was a promise to set up a loss and damage fund. And so I think in some ways, it’s a test of whether countries can follow through on what seemed to be good intentions. DOERING: We’ll have to see what happens. Bob Berwyn is a reporter with Inside Climate News based in Austria. Thank you so much, Bob. BERWYN: Thanks for having me.

The fund is meant to compensate low-income countries that suffer disproportionately from climate-related disasters, exacerbated by actions of wealthier nations. The urgency of this matter is highlighted by a staggering $4.3 trillion in global economic losses over the past 50 years due to extreme weather, with small nations like Vanuatu facing damages up to 60 percent of their GDP from single events. \n As COP28 in Dubai approaches, disagreements persist on key operational aspects of the fund, including its hosting entity.

They argue for an independent financial institution more aligned with United Nations principles. Meanwhile, developed nations like the U.S., France, and Australia support the World Bank’s administration, citing its established mechanisms for managing such funds. \n Berwyn emphasizes that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) operates on consensus and voluntary commitments, which can be both a strength and a weakness. This process allows for flexibility in response to changing political dynamics but lacks binding enforcement. \n While specific funding amounts have not been settled, developing countries have proposed starting with $100 billion by 2030, and independent research suggests that loss and damage could cost up to $500 billion by 2050. The origins of the loss and damage concept trace back to the inception of the UNFCCC in 1992, acknowledging the disparities between countries contributing to and those affected by climate change. \nThe discussion also touches on the responsibility of fossil fuel companies and oil-producing nations for climate change, noting the intertwined nature of some countries' governments and their fossil fuel industries. \n With COP28 on the horizon, the pressure is on for the transitional committee to finalize recommendations for the fund. The upcoming conference will test the COP process's ability to fulfill its commitments amidst continuing challenges such as increasing deforestation and rising methane emissions, contrary to previous pledges. \n Berwyn's insights indicate a deepening rift between developed and developing countries on financial and environmental justice. The success or failure at COP28 to establish an effective loss and damage fund will likely serve as a barometer for the world's collective will to address climate inequities and honor international climate agreements.\",\"date\": \"Sat, 28 Oct 2023\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/insideclimatenews.org\/news\/28102023\/cop27-cop28-loss-damage-fund-disagreement\/\",\"source\": \"climatenews\",\"title\": \"Final Negotiations for a Climate 'Loss and Damage' Fund Between Rich and Poor Nations\"}"}

Drought, flooding and extreme weather are driving and amplifying violent conflict around the world. At the same time, warfare has devastated ecosystems, imperiled access to vital resources and left behind toxic legacies that sicken civilian populations. On Thursday, a coalition of human rights organizations and lawyers published an open letter urging the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor, Karim A. A. Khan, to begin assessing the links between climate change and crimes in the court’s remit. The letter also calls on Khan to prioritize the prosecution of crimes that cause environmental destruction, citing a host of examples: In the Lake Chad basin, drought and extreme weather have put agriculture-dependent communities in precarious economic situations, increasing the likelihood that young men will be recruited into militant groups like Boko Haram. In Ukraine, Russia’s destruction of the Kakhovka Dam flooded and forced downstream communities from their homes, caused mass fish die-offs and affected communities’ access to fresh water.

And in Afghanistan, four decades of near constant war have decimated the country’s landscape and sparked conflict over land rights, water and other natural resources while pollution caused by military operations has sickened war-torn civilian populations. “Climate change and ecological degradation must be given due legal consideration as the threat multipliers to international peace and security that they are,” said Richard J. Rogers, the executive director of the Netherlands-based Climate Counsel and a signatory of the open letter. Kahn’s office at the International Criminal Court in The Hague declined to directly respond to the open letter, but in a written statement said the office was preparing a new policy on environmental crimes. “This policy will elaborate on how the Office will use its jurisdiction to address environmental damage that occurs in the context of Rome Statute crimes,” the statement said, referring to the treaty that enumerates the crimes the court has jurisdiction over. The statement also said the new policy will not be limited to environmental damage committed as a war crime, which is already itemized in the Rome Statute, but will also “explore how other Rome Statute crimes may be committed by means of or resulting in environmental damage.” In recent years, the Office of the Prosecutor has received at least five requests urging the prosecutor to investigate alleged crimes against humanity involving environmental damage in Cambodia and Brazil. The Rome Statute does not explicitly list environmental destruction as an act of crimes against humanity, but legal scholars argue the Office of the Prosecutor has authority to prosecute crimes against humanity and war crimes involving environmental destruction. Since the court began operating in 2002, neither Khan nor his two predecessors have prosecuted any environmental crimes. Gathering evidence on climatic-drivers of crimes, however, would be a new addition to the court’s operations. The signatories of the open letter argue that the task falls within the prosecutor’s existing mandate. Rogers said the court’s prosecutor already engages in the gathering of evidence and could add a component on climate change such as asking witnesses if they have experienced changes in weather patterns and if so what effect that had on a conflict. The idea advanced by Rogers and others is that Khan’s office is well positioned to build a body of knowledge about the connections between climate change and international crimes that could help international institutions and policy makers take action to address the root causes of violence, and ideally prevent it from happening in the first place. The open letter, spearheaded by the Sudan Human Rights Hub and Climate Counsel, warned that “nearly every geopolitical crisis on Earth is now marked in one way or another by environmental strife” and made five recommendations including that the court appoint a special advisor on climate security, implement a “forensic” climate analysis into its investigations and publicly support adding “ecocide” to the court’s list of crimes. Others who supported the letter are Sudanese Lawyers for Justice, the Sudanese Center for Legal Aid, the Darfur Bar Association, the Darfur Network for Monitoring and Documentation, the Darfur Internally Displaced Persons and Refugees Coordination Body and the Human Rights and Advocacy Network for Democracy. The International Committee of the Red Cross, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, NATO and an array of United Nations bodies, including the Security Council and Environment Programme, have to varying degrees sounded the alarm that climate change–while not a cause of conflict in and of itself—is making large scale violence around the world more likely and worsening existing conflicts. The open letter highlighted the long running violence in Sudan’s Darfur region, which former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon characterized in 2007 as the world’s first climate change conflict. Fighting there began in 2003 when Sudanese government forces and allied militias clashed with rebel groups in the Darfur region, prompting the U.N. Security Council to make its first case referral to the International Criminal Court. Since 2005, the court’s prosecutor has been investigating allegations of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity involving mass killings, forced displacement, rapes and other widespread attacks on civilians. Following the 2019 outster of the country’s long time dictator Omar al-Bashir, Sudan appeared to be moving toward democratic rule. But in mid-April of this year, fighting broke out between the nation’s military and a paramilitary group. Over the course of six months, the fighting has displaced millions and killed roughly 9,000 people. In July, Khan announced his office was investigating new allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the region. Khan told the U.N. Security Council that his office was reviewing allegations regarding looting, burnings of homes and killings, including the alleged murder of 87 Masalit people by the paramilitary group Rapid Support Force and its allies in West Darfur. “We are, by any analysis, not on the precipice of a human catastrophe but in the very midst of one. It is occurring,” Khan told the council in July. Though the acute cause of the recent conflict in Sudan has been a power struggle over who will control the nation’s political future, Sudanese human rights groups say climate impacts—drought, desertification, rising temperatures and water scarcity—are a root cause and amplifier of violence.

Sudan is one of the five countries in the world most vulnerable to climate change. Over a 40-year period beginning in the late 1960s, rainfall in western Sudan dropped by 30 percent while the Sahara desert has expanded about one mile per year there. Meanwhile, temperatures in Sudan, already one of the world’s hottest countries, have been increasing. These impacts have reduced the amount of land suitable for agriculture and intensified competition for resources. Some farmers who have lost their land to desertification have turned to small-scale gold mining, which has been linked to mercury and cyanide pollution. As women in the parched region are forced to walk longer distances to obtain clean water, they are exposed to higher risks of sexual and other assaults. Moneim Adam, a human rights lawyer and the director of Sudan Human Rights Hub, said “climatic drivers of conflict and environmental atrocity crimes are now the lived reality” for Sudanese civilians and other communities around the world. “Communities already struggling to access sufficient land and water cannot face these crimes alone,” Adam said. “The ICC must address these issues if it is to remain a relevant force for the current century.”\",\"date\": \"Thu, 26 Oct 2023 09:00:00 GMT\"\"link\": \"https:\/\/insideclimatenews.org\/news\/26102023\/how-climate-change-drives-conflict-and-war-crimes-around-the-globe\/\",\"source\": \"climatenews\",\"title\": \"How Climate Change Drives Conflict and War Crimes Around the Globe\"}"},

A. Khan, highlights the growing concern among human rights organizations and legal professionals regarding the intricate links between climate change and violent conflict. The coalition is pushing the ICC to consider the environmental devastation and resource scarcity that often accompany and exacerbate armed conflict as crimes within its jurisdiction. \n The letter illustrates several examples where environmental destruction and climate phenomena such as drought and extreme weather have not only heightened economic insecurity but also fueled recruitment into militant groups, as seen in the Lake Chad basin with groups like Boko Haram. Additionally, it cites Russia's destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in Ukraine, causing significant ecological and social upheaval, and the four decades of conflict in Afghanistan that have led to land degradation and heightened competition over natural resources. \n The ICC, based in The Hague, has acknowledged the call to action without committing to specific steps, stating that it is formulating a new policy on environmental crimes. This policy is anticipated to address environmental damage associated with crimes outlined in the Rome Statute, the ICC's founding treaty, beyond the scope of war crimes to include other crimes. \n While environmental destruction is not currently listed as a distinct crime against humanity under the Rome Statute, legal experts argue that the ICC has the authority to prosecute such cases when they are part of broader crimes against humanity or war crimes. However, since its establishment in 2002, the ICC has not prosecuted any environmental crimes, despite having received requests to investigate related crimes against humanity in Cambodia and Brazil. \n The letter's signatories, including the Sudan Human Rights Hub and the Climate Counsel, emphasize the urgency of integrating climate considerations into legal assessments of international crimes. They propose that the ICC should add a climate analysis component to its evidence-gathering processes, appoint a special advisor on climate security, and support the inclusion of 'ecocide' as a prosecutable offense. \n Highlighting Sudan as a case study, the open letter reiterates how climate change has exacerbated conflicts, with reduced rainfall, rising temperatures, and expanding deserts driving fierce competition over dwindling resources. Human rights groups attribute these climatic stresses as underlying factors contributing to the violence and human rights abuses in the region.\",\"date\": \"Thu, 26 Oct 2023\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/insideclimatenews.org\/news\/26102023\/how-climate-change-drives-conflict-and-war-crimes-around-the-globe\/\",\"source\": \"climatenews\",\"title\": \"Climate Change: A Catalyst for Global Conflict and War Crimes\"}"}

The 10 grants, announced and awarded by the foundation earlier this month, will also go toward restoration of aquatic and terrestrial habitat for at-risk species. They are expected to leverage more than $9.4 million in matching contributions, for a total conservation impact of over $19 million. Evan Isaacson, senior attorney and research director for the Chesapeake Legal Alliance, a regional nonprofit providing legal services to protect the estuary, said the grants would fund important local projects, such as a nearly $2.5 million award to the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay for vegetative environmental buffers to improve regional water quality. But even more important than the grants for restoring the bay, streams and wetlands, Isaacson said, are proper implementation and enforcement of the Clean Water Act and state water pollution control laws.

To that end, Isaascon said, a new report from the Chesapeake Bay Program’s Science and Technology Advisory Committee found that watershed restoration efforts have been offset by massive growth in nutrient inputs to the watershed from mainly agricultural runoff. “Investments like these are critical, but just one piece of the overall puzzle,” he said of the new grants. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $238 million for restoration of the bay over five years to fund regional, bay-wide programs covering Innovative Nutrient and Sediment Reduction (INSR), Small Watershed Grants and the Most Effective Basins. “These projects represent a portion of the generational investments that the Biden Administration is making in the Chesapeake Bay watershed,” said Adam Ortiz, the EPA’s Mid-Atlantic regional administrator. “Each one of them will improve not just the local environment where the projects are located, but the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem downstream by removing runoff pollution, cleaning up streams and rivers and planting native trees and grasses.” Jeff Trandahl, executive director and CEO of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, said that the grants will advance “on-the-ground, voluntary and community-based approaches to accelerate water quality improvements for the bay and its tributary rivers and streams.” The grants will enhance resilience for the bay’s human and wildlife communities and help restore vital living resources across the bay watershed, he added. In a July report, the EPA’s Inspector General listed several factors responsible for the nonattainment of 2025 Bay Restoration Goals. One was the EPA’s own lack of leadership in rallying support behind regional efforts to contain pollution and prevent its fouling of the bay’s tributaries, especially from nonpoint pollution sources such as agricultural and industrial runoff. The agency did not adopt a strategy that factored in new challenges to its pollution control efforts, such as climate change, the report added. “The Chesapeake Bay Program is not on track to have all controls and practices in place by 2025 to meet its Total Maximum Daily Load, or TMDL, for excess nutrients,” the report said. “The EPA has not yet led Chesapeake Bay Program partners to adopt new goals or update deadlines that will more accurately reflect the time necessary to address the remaining sources of pollution covered by the TMDL.” In response, Ortiz, the Mid-Atlantic regional administrator, questioned those findings in a letter and said the EPA IG’s “report did not correct several of the factual inaccuracies in the draft,” and that the EPA does not have authority to impose a new strategy on nine signatory parties to the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. ICN provides award-winning climate coverage free of charge and advertising. We rely on donations from readers like you to keep going. “EPA has limited authority under the Clean Water Act to regulate or manage nonpoint sources,” the letter stated, and added that the EPA Region 3 office “cannot commit to a date for when such a strategy would be developed, adopted, and\/or implemented.” Ortiz’ letter wrapped up by acknowledging the “challenges in meeting the partnership’s 2025 water quality goals and is currently engaged in efforts to make progress between now and 2025, as well as beyond 2025.” Betsy Nicholas, vice president of programs at the nonprofit Potomac Riverkeeper Network, said bay restoration depends upon strong legal enforcement. “Voluntary measures alone will never be enough to protect our water quality,” she said. “We have strong laws on the books but they are not being enforced.” Since 2022, the Chesapeake Bay Program has invested $30 million in infrastructure funding towards restoration efforts in the watershed’s most effective basins. More than half of that funding has gone towards agriculture conservation practices to help reduce harmful farm runoff from impacting local rivers and streams and the Bay.

The company, called Rockhopper, brought its claim not in Italian courts but through a system of international arbitration that allows foreign investors to sue governments. Last year, the company won the case along with an order that the Italian government pay Rockhopper about $200 million. On Thursday, a United Nations expert warned that cases like these could be the beginning of a wave of litigation that threatens to undermine climate action as nations look to phase out fossil fuel development. David Boyd, the special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, told a committee of the U.N. General Assembly that governments are being targeted with dozens of legal claims seeking hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, with many of those suits brought by oil and mining companies.

Instead of making polluters pay, states are paying polluters.” Boyd was presenting the findings of a report about a corner of international law known as investor-state dispute settlements, or ISDS, which has been enshrined by a web of some 3,000 investment treaties and trade agreements, many of which date to the 1990s. The agreements generally offer protections for foreign investors and allow them to file arbitration claims if government actions harm their interests. Corporations have filed more than 1,250 claims since the 1990s, with the number accelerating over the last decade along with a rise in foreign investment, although the true number of cases is unknown because many remain secret. Their claims are typically heard by three-member arbitration panels made up of attorneys, with each side nominating one member who, together, pick the third. Arguments are then heard behind closed doors by the arbitrators, whose awards are binding on the parties. Pakistan was ordered to pay nearly $6 billion to a joint Canadian-Chilean mining company in 2019 after declining to issue it a license. After a protracted legal battle, the parties reached a settlement last year that waived the award in exchange for allowing the mine to proceed. The Republic of the Congo is currently facing claims from three foreign mining companies seeking more than $30 billion, twice the nation’s gross domestic product. Oil, gas and mining companies have lodged more claims than any other industry, with many of the awards reaching into the billions of dollars. The 12 largest awards alone, 11 of which have gone to fossil fuel or mining companies, totaled more than $95 billion, according to Boyd’s report, a figure that “likely exceeds the total amount of damages awarded by all courts to victims of human rights violations in all States worldwide, ever.” While the system was intended to help protect companies when governments nationalize their assets, the report and many other critics of ISDS say that multinational corporations have “weaponized” these protections to challenge new environmental regulations, taxes and other policies that cut into profits. Because the majority of cases have been filed by corporations from the United States, Europe and Canada against developing nations, many advocates and academics have warned that the ISDS system could further cripple those countries’ ability to address climate change by deepening their foreign debts and constraining their ability to enact environmental protections. One study published last year in Science identified some $340 billion in potential ISDS claims from oil and gas companies if governments were to begin limiting production. The fear is that countries faced with the threat of lawsuits will either back down from restricting development or will proceed and be forced to pay sometimes crippling sums, said Kyla Tienhaara, an associate professor at the School of Environmental Studies at Queen’s University in Canada and the paper’s lead author. The United States currently faces a $15 billion claim from TC Energy, the Canadian firm behind the Keystone XL oil pipeline, after the Biden administration canceled a permit for that project. The Netherlands faces a $1.5 billion claim from the German utility RWE, which sued over the Dutch government’s plan to phase out coal by 2030. Denmark, New Zealand and France have limited their own climate policies because of the threat of ISDS claims, according to Boyd’s report, and the Spanish government told him that the system discourages countries from transitioning off fossil fuels. While it is primarily wealthy nations that have faced claims directly tied to climate action, developing nations are far more exposed. According to Tienhaara’s research, Mozambique has the highest potential liability from limiting oil and gas development, up to $31 billion, followed by Guyana and Venezuela. “Something has to be done,” Boyd said in an interview with Inside Climate News in advance of his presentation. “Governments have to take action to protect themselves from these cases and to stop this before it gets worse.” Encouraging Foreign Investment? Many industry groups insist that criticism of ISDS are overblown, arguing that national courts discriminate against foreign investors and that the system provides “neutral” forums to resolve disputes. “ISDS procedures ensure that other countries treat U.S. investors fairly,” U.S. business groups have argued, and “do not seize their property without compensation.” High profile nationalizations have taken place in Argentina, Bolivia and Venezuela, among other countries, and remain a prevailing risk for investors in the natural resources sector. Business groups also argue that ISDS protections are necessary to attract foreign investment, improving developing countries’ economies. At least one study from the U.S. International Trade Commission concluded that binding ISDS guarantees resulted in increased foreign investment in both developed and developing countries. A growing number of research studies from academics and advocacy organizations contradict that finding, indicating that there is no link between ISDS and increased foreign direct investment. Those studies point to South Africa, Brazil and India as examples of nations that have resisted or limited enmeshment in ISDS while continuing to draw investment from abroad. Meanwhile, lower- and middle-income countries have been defendants in about two-thirds of all publicly reported ISDS cases, according to the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment. Latin American countries alone have paid out over $33 billion in damages or settlements. That imbalance, coupled with the fact that the majority of claimants are from Europe and North America, has provoked allegations that ISDS promotes “economic colonialism.” Lisa Sachs, director of Columbia University’s Center on Sustainable Investment, and other critics of the system say multinationals have other options for protecting their investments, including political risk insurance. Sachs said international investment law should focus on how to drive financing into climate-friendly sectors rather than perpetuating a system that is being used to protect the economic interests of fossil fuel companies. Critics have identified a host of problems with the system beyond its impact on environmental protections, including that it prioritizes the economic rights of companies over human rights of local communities. Others say ISDS lacks transparency and that protections are based on vague standards like “fair and equitable treatment” that lead to inconsistent outcomes and give private arbitrators sway over public policy. ISDS cases have been lucrative for law firms, which have begun advising clients on how to preemptively structure themselves to take advantage of the ISDS system. The U.S. law firm Jones Day, for instance, issued a client newsletter in 2022 advising fossil fuel companies to review their operations to ensure they had access to ISDS protections: “Such restructuring should take place before any climate-related dispute with the State has arisen or is reasonably foreseeable,” the newsletter said. Withdrawal and Reform Wealthy countries have recently begun shielding themselves from ISDS. Within the United States, calls to remove ISDS from free trade agreements have found common cause on both sides of the political spectrum. In renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Trump administration dropped ISDS between the United States and Canada based in part upon the belief that the system infringes on U.S. sovereignty and encourages American companies to invest, and move jobs, abroad. On the left, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has long argued against international arbitration. Like the United States, European countries have taken steps to protect themselves, with many withdrawing from the Energy Charter Treaty, a 90s-era multilateral free trade agreement aimed at promoting investment in energy development. The Energy Charter Treaty has spawned billions of dollars in ISDS claims over governments’ decisions to phase out fossil fuels. So far, Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland have either withdrawn or given notice of their intended withdrawal from the treaty, which has been widely maligned as incompatible with global climate goals. ICN provides award-winning climate coverage free of charge and advertising. We rely on donations from readers like you to keep going. And yet, these wealthy nations generally have not withdrawn from treaties with poorer nations that tend to benefit corporations headquartered in the Global North. “The inequality, injustice and hypocrisy are staggering,” Boyd’s report said. At the U.N. hearing, representatives of the United States and European Union said little about the report beyond stressing that they are already leading efforts to reform the ISDS system within the World Bank and U.N. agencies that handle trade and investment disputes. Those efforts, which have dragged on for years, have mostly focused on adjusting the procedural mechanisms of ISDS, such as creating a permanent pathway for governments to bring counterclaims. Some newer investment treaties have included provisions that aim to exempt climate, environmental and other regulations from ISDS exposure. But Boyd and many other critics of ISDS have argued that the system is so inherently flawed that the only option is to eliminate it altogether. Developing nations, Boyd told the delegates, “should form a collective effort to tear up these existing agreements between those states, and in particular beginning with the European Union, Canada and the United States,” he said. “Because how can those wealthy northern nations object to having the same basic system for developing states when they won’t accept it themselves.” Correction: This article has been updated after an earlier version gave the wrong country involved in an investor-state dispute settlement with three foreign mining companies.

This case has been highlighted by David Boyd, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, as potentially the start of a trend where such legal mechanisms may impede climate action. Boyd spoke to the U.N. General Assembly, pointing out the numerous legal claims made against governments by oil and mining companies demanding vast sums which could have serious implications on environmental efforts. \n ISDS is enshrined in about 3,000 international treaties, enabling corporations to sue governments if actions taken by these governments harm their interests.

Critics argue that ISDS has been 'weaponized' by corporations to challenge new environmental regulations, undermining national efforts to address climate change. Developing countries are especially vulnerable, facing lawsuits that can exceed their GDP, potentially locking them into fossil fuel dependency. \n There is a significant debate over whether ISDS systems actually encourage foreign investment. While some industry groups argue that these mechanisms ensure fair treatment of U.S. investors overseas, studies indicate no link between ISDS and increased foreign direct investment. Critics like Lisa Sachs from Columbia University's Center on Sustainable Investment suggest that international investment law should instead focus on supporting climate-friendly sectors. \n Recently, some wealthy nations have taken steps to withdraw from or reform ISDS mechanisms, like the United States and several European countries exiting the Energy Charter Treaty.

Those once-ordinary names are now associated with grim memories. For many, just hearing them produces a sense of foreboding—which storm will be the next to join the long line of hurricanes that have altered countless lives and helped shape the course of U.S. history? Nobody knows where and when that next big storm will hit. But a new study, published Thursday in Scientific Reports, found that in recent decades Atlantic hurricanes were far more likely to dial up from weak Category 1 to major Category 3 or higher storms in only 24 hours. Storms from 2001 to 2020 did so at more than twice the rate as the same types of storms between 1970 and 1990. Exactly what might be fueling this trend, and whether it will continue into the future, are two questions with major implications for millions of people throughout the Americas. Andra Garner, a meteorologist and climate scientist at Rowan University, analyzed wind speeds and how they changed over the lifespan of every Atlantic hurricane between 1970 and 2020. She identified each storm’s greatest increase in maximum wind speed during a 24-hour period—the maximum intensification rate. She then grouped the storms into three periods (1970 to 1990, 1986 to 2005, and 2001 to 2020) and created an “average storm” for each. Comparing those averages shows that recent hurricanes have intensified to significant strengths more quickly. While the probability of a weak storm becoming a major one in 24 hours was only 3.23 percent between 1970 and 1990, it was 8.12 percent between 2001 and 2020. Between 1970 and 1990, 42.3 percent of storms had wind speeds intensify by 23 miles per hour or more over the span of 24 hours. Between 2001 and 2020, 56.7 percent of the storms grew more powerful by that same measure. The data also showed that geography played a role in maximum intensification rates. Hurricanes strengthened more quickly in the Caribbean Sea and off the U.S. Atlantic coast than they did in the Gulf of Mexico. While the study did not include an analysis that attempts to firmly identify the cause or causes of the more quickly intensifying storms, Garner interprets the results as a warning call on how climate change is raising sea surface temperatures. “More work would need to be done to see exactly how these changes might carry through in the future, and firmly identify all the variables that are playing a role here,” she says. “But we’ve already seen in just the last 50 years, this change in the rate at which storms are intensifying, while we’ve seen the ocean get warmer over that same time period.” Hurricanes are fueled by warm surface water. A cluster of thunderstorms at sea can suck heat energy from evaporating surface water up into the air, which creates a ton of humidity. When that water vapor condenses into clouds and rain, its stored heat is released and can result in hurricanes, which convert energy into powerful winds. “So I think it’s fair to say that if we don’t take action to limit future climate change,” Garner says, “this is a trend that I think we would continue to see worsen in the future.” While Garner’s position serves as a warning, currently the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) asserts that “a detectable greenhouse gas influence on hurricane activity has not been identified with high confidence.” That’s because other hurricane fueling factors are in play, from atmospheric aerosol levels to long term shifts in ocean circulation patterns. Rapid intensification is associated with particularly powerful, destructive storms, and Garner’s study isn’t the first to note that it has become more common. “Their results are consistent with those of several other recent studies, in that they demonstrate that the number of rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Basin has been increasing in the 2000s compared with previous decades,” says Sharan Majumdar, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami. Majumdar does caution that all such studies have some uncertainties in their estimates of tropical cyclone intensity, especially in earlier decades, because satellite and aircraft flight data weren’t as robust in the 1970s and 1980s. Majumdar recently co-wrote a study that found that rapid intensifications—wind speed boosts of more than 34 mph in 24 hours—increased significantly between the 1980-2000 period and that of 2001-2021. And the regional differences he documented in hurricane intensification rates largely matched those seen in Garner’s research. Rapid intensifications increased by 68 percent in the Yucatan and Caribbean Sea region, and by 50 percent in the southern North Atlantic region. The Gulf of Mexico saw only a 21 percent increase. “We found that these increases in intensification appear to be more closely related to the increase in sea surface temperature than to changes in the vertical wind shear or relative humidity,” he explains. But the story of intensifying hurricanes isn’t a simple matter of heating up the sea’s surface. Tom Knutson, a climate scientist at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, is an expert on how climate change is influencing hurricanes. Knutson notes that much research shows various different measures of Atlantic hurricane strength have increased from the 1970s and ’80s to recent years. Any of three major factors during that period, or combinations of them, might be responsible: greenhouse gas warming; a major decrease in aerosol air pollution, which previously reflected sunlight to help cool ocean waters; or natural variability related to changes in ocean circulation. “Greenhouse gas-induced warming may have done it all, it may have contributed to it, or it may have contributed very little,” he says of the escalating hurricane intensification identified in the new study. “My personal opinion is that these results are basically showing the difference between two periods, and they aren’t making a very strong case that what they are seeing is actually due to greenhouse gas-induced warming.” If the observed Atlantic hurricane changes are due to factors like aerosol levels or ocean circulation changes, the intensification trend likely won’t continue into the future, he notes. Worldwide, since reliable global satellite data began to be collected in the 1980s, there has been a remarkably consistent average of about 80 tropical cyclones each year. Most current research suggests that Atlantic hurricanes won’t become more frequent, and they may actually become less frequent with climate change. That sounds like good news, but it shouldn’t be entirely reassuring. Research also shows that the hurricanes we are experiencing are becoming more destructive, and that trend also seems likely to continue—because of climate change and human behavior. Climate change is causing hurricanes to produce more rainfall, according to reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. For every degree Celsius of warming, studies suggest, rainfall rates may rise by about 7 percent. So under a 2-degree Celsius warming scenario, hurricanes will be expected to saturate impacted communities with 14 percent more rainfall. Sea-level rise, which drives the frequency and severity of coastal flooding, is another destructive factor that’s projected to worsen by perhaps two feet by the year 2100. Since 1960, sea levels have already risen in many parts of the U.S. The coasts of Texas and Louisiana have seen a surge of more than eight inches over that time. And as coastal development continues to grow, more people and buildings are placed squarely in harm’s way. Because of this, damages from tropical storms have increased significantly over time and will continue to do so even if storm behavior remains the same. Garner suspects, given projections of future ocean warming, that hurricanes won’t remain the same and will continue to intensify, making the changes we’ve already seen “a bit of an urgent warning” about what may be to come. Knutson stresses that the science remains unsettled on how to interpret what’s gone on with hurricane behavior in the Atlantic basin over the last half-century. He notes we don’t know exactly how factors like aerosols and ocean circulation have contributed to what has been observed. “It’s an open question, and an important question, because it does have implications for the future,” he says. “If it actually is greenhouse gas-dominated, then we would indeed expect this trend to continue into the future with some pretty dire consequences.” Editor’s note, October 20, 2023: This story has been updated to more accurately summarize Tom Knutson’s comments about external factors affecting the strength of hurricanes.

The study, conducted by Andra Garner, a climate scientist at Rowan University, examined wind speed data for every Atlantic hurricane from 1970 to 2020 to determine the maximum 24-hour wind speed increase, revealing that the likelihood of a hurricane intensifying from Category 1 to Category 3 or higher within a 24-hour period more than doubled from 3.23% in the period between 1970 and 1990 to 8.12% between 2001 and 2020. \n Garner did not pin down the exact causes of this trend in her study, but she suggests that increased sea surface temperatures due to climate change may be a contributing factor. Hurricanes derive energy from warm surface water, and the association between higher ocean temperatures and increased hurricane intensity has been documented in several other recent studies. For instance, Sharan Majumdar from the University of Miami observed that rapid hurricane intensifications in the Atlantic Basin have been increasing since the 2000s. \n However, there is some debate within the scientific community. While Garner's findings suggest a link between warming seas and stronger hurricanes, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) holds that a definite connection between human-induced climate change and hurricane activity is not yet established with high confidence. This is due to the complex interplay of other factors such as atmospheric aerosols and long-term ocean circulation patterns that also affect hurricane development and strength. \n The study also found geographical differences in hurricane intensification rates, with the Caribbean Sea and the U.S. Atlantic coast witnessing more rapid intensifications than the Gulf of Mexico. Tom Knutson, a climate scientist at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, points out that multiple factors could be behind the observed increase in hurricane intensity since the 1970s, including greenhouse gas-induced warming, decreased aerosol pollution, and natural variability. \n Despite uncertainties, the trend toward more destructive hurricanes is clear. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports that hurricanes are likely to produce more rainfall, with estimates of a 7% increase per degree Celsius of warming. Additionally, sea-level rise exacerbates the destructive potential of storms, and with coastal development continuing, the damage potential increases. \n Garner's study serves as a cautionary note on the potential future trends of hurricane intensification in the face of ongoing climate change, though more research is necessary to understand the precise mechanisms at play and to predict future patterns accurately.\",\"date\": \"Thu, 19 Oct 2023\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/science-nature\/atlantic-hurricanes-are-more-likely-to-power-up-quickly-180983104\/\", \"source\": \"smithsonianmag\",\"title\": \"Atlantic Storms Intensify Faster in Climate Change Era\"}"}

        {"role": "user", "content": "{\"_id\": \"653eb9c5db4cb73d3b092202\",\"author\": \"Brian Handwerk\",\"category\": \"nature\",\"content\": \"Archaeologists are rewriting the story of an early human child whose fossilized jaw and impacted teeth were discovered more than 40 years ago in the Ethiopian highlands. Scientists used high-tech imaging to reveal that early humans, apparently Homo erectus, inhabited this high-altitude plateau two million years ago. Their work provides more evidence that even early in our evolutionary journey, our Homo ancestors weren’t confined to warm African lowlands. Instead, they took advantage of a variety of diverse environments—a precursor of their ability to subsequently spread out across the prehistoric world. The team analyzed the teeth and jaw as never before, and they published their findings Thursday in Science. They compared the teeth to those of other early Homo species and suggest that the child was H. erectus. That group likely made and used the abundant stone tools of the Oldowan technology found with the fossil, the authors say, as well as the more advanced Acheulean tools also found in the area, from nearly the same time period. This suggests, the authors theorize, that these early highlanders adapted quickly to a high-altitude environment. Study co-author Margherita Mussi, an archaeologist at Sapienza University in Rome, and colleagues combined two techniques: argon-argon dating and a recently completed paleomagnetic dating analysis to fine-tune the site’s ages. The fossil and Oldowan artifacts with it had previously been dated to 1.7 million to 1.8 million years ago, but revised ages now place them at some two million years old. The team also used advanced imaging technology to study the fossil and suggest which species it represents. “This analysis gave us information inside the teeth, in extremely high detail and comparison with a lot of teeth that are already assessed as Homo erectus,” Mussi says. Researchers couldn’t determine the child’s sex based on the ancient teeth and jaw, but since so many such fossils have been categorized as male, Mussi took the liberty of deciding the ancient child was a girl whom she affectionally nicknamed “Little Garba.” The child’s remains were found in 1981, at an important prehistoric site known as the Melka Kunture complex. It stretches over several square miles of the Ethiopian highlands 30 miles from Addis Ababa. Over the years, previous analysis of the mandible and teeth have suggested affinities with a variety of early Homo species including not only H. erectus but also Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. Determining exactly which early humans lived here involved taking the sample around the globe. Just as H. erectus eventually migrated across much of the prehistoric world, the child’s jawbone went on its own improbable journey some two million years after its owner died. Mussi got permission from the Ethiopian government to carry the precious artifact by hand to the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. The cutting-edge imaging facility’s Extremely Brilliant Source can analyze objects in detail with X-rays 100 billion times brighter than those commonly found in hospitals. ESRF produced a suite of images showing external features of tooth surfaces like crown heights and shapes, and internal ones, like junctions between enamel and the tooth’s underlying dentine. The team compared them with features found in the known examples of various early Homo species. That analysis, they say, suggests Little Garba was Homo erectus, the first of our ancient ancestor species to have body proportions much like our own—longer legs adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle and bigger brains. Homo erectus was also the most successful of all human species, at least so far. They survived for a staggering period of time, nearly two million years, before fading out about 110,000 years ago in their last stronghold of Java, Indonesia. If the fossil does represent Homo erectus, it would be the first known appearance of the species in East Africa. That’s entirely plausible, since the species is known in South Africa some two million years ago. But it’s not a sure thing. Tooth morphology offers a wealth of information for determining species—but old teeth for comparison number not in the thousands or hundreds but in the tens. “I’m not sure that we can call the species Homo erectus,” says paleoanthropologist Miriam Belmaker, of the University of Tulsa, who was not involved in the new study. “It’s of course Homo, but the jury is still out if it could be Homo ergaster, or Homo rudolfensis, which the authors simply didn’t have any teeth of to compare.” No matter the child’s exact species, their community thrived in a high-altitude locale quite a bit different from established evolutionary hot spots like South Africa and the Great Rift Valley. “This is 2,000 meters [6,500 feet] of elevation, and that has a lot of consequences,” Mussi explains. In the plateau’s thin air, the prehistoric climate was far different from that of the lowlands, as it remains today. “In a nutshell, it was always rather cool and rainy, and that means the vegetation was different,” Mussi says. Work on fossil pollen by co-author Raymonde Bonnefille and others at the site has identified dozens of ancient species so far, none of which was also found on the savanna. The animals were different as well. Elephants and rhinos were found only in very small numbers, while unique subspecies distinct from those in surrounding lowlands roamed the area. Saying that early Homo was able to adapt to this environment feels too passive for Mussi. “I would say they were taking advantage,” she says. “They were perfectly able to live in a different environment.” “The most interesting thing in the paper, to me, is that it occurs in the highlands,” says Richard Potts, director of the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History.\n\n“Now we know, back to two million years ago, it’s part of the array of environments that H. erectus occupied in Africa at that time,” he adds. “But also it’s the foreshadowing of all the different kinds of environments that H. erectus would move into and populate.” By about 1.7 million years ago, they were found in China at 40 degrees north latitude, a pretty cold environment. And by about the same time, they were found in the Caucasus in what is now the country of Georgia, another cooler environment where Europe meets Asia. “If they had not been able to make use of the resources to stay in places which are cool and rainy, with different vegetation and animals, how would they have reached the Caucasus?” Mussi asks. The fossil was found with a variety of Oldowan tools. These tool types, which our distant ancestors began making at least 2.6 million years ago, were basic, including hammerstones for bludgeoning and sharp flakes that were struck off larger cores to provide a sharp cutting edge. But in only slightly younger layers, relating to 1.95 million years ago, researchers unearthed some of the oldest known examples of early Acheulean lithic technology. Acheulean hand axes and cleavers represent a more sophisticated type of production. They were created by taking a large stone flake and painstakingly shaping it into an ax head by repeatedly striking and breaking smaller pieces off the edges. “I’m very impressed that the Oldowan and Acheulean tools overlapped in time and space for 200,000 years, with excellent dating,” says Belmaker. “I think that is very interesting.” She says two different early human species may have also overlapped while dwelling in these highlands, and each utilized a different toolkit. Belmaker notes that sites elsewhere in Eurasia suggest migrations by two different hominin populations, using Oldowan and Acheulean tool technologies at the same time. Something similar might have happened as humans moved into the highlands. “Early Homo was beginning to travel both north and south,” she says. “What’s nice about this paper is that it adds another dimension to this expansion, which is up.” Potts believes that the same species, H. erectus or a very close relative, may have been present throughout. Changing tool technologies are sometimes viewed as a linear process of improvement, in which inferior older implements are quickly discarded when new, different types of tools are made, he notes. But that’s not always the reality. “Being adaptable can also mean flipping back and forth between different stone tool technologies under slightly different circumstances,” he says, “based on many factors like raw materials, conditions or how quickly food had to be processed.” “Behaviors can be adopted in a flexible way,” he says, “and H. erectus certainly must have been that way.” One clear aspect of Homo erectus’ flexibility was the wide variety of areas, geographical and now topographical, that they were able to call home. The species was the first great disperser in human evolutionary history and not your ordinary primate. “Not only is it bipedal, not only does it make and depend upon stone tools, but it’s also moving into all sorts of non-tropical environments,” Potts says. “Here we are really dealing with the makings of who we became.” Editor's Note, October 13, 2023: This article originally misstated the remains were found more than a half century ago.

Known for their brightness and speed, these meteors produce “one of the most beautiful showers of the year,” according to NASA. The Orionids will be best visible in the hours after midnight to anyone in the world with clear skies and minimal light pollution. You won’t need any special equipment to view this shower, but NASA recommends finding a dark place and setting up a sleeping bag, blanket or lawn chair for comfort.  If you’re located in the Northern Hemisphere, lie down with your feet facing southeast. If you’re in the Southern Hemisphere, your feet should face northeast. You’ll see the most meteors if you look to the lower half of the sky, unless the sky near your horizon is brightly lit, per the International Meteor Organization (IMO). You should allow at least 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust—avoid looking at your phone or a flashlight, otherwise your night vision will need another 30 minutes to kick in.  The Orionids travel at about 148,000 miles per hour into Earth’s atmosphere, often leaving spectacular glowing \"trains\" that can last several seconds to minutes. They can also sometimes turn into fireballs, or very bright meteors, per NASA. Usually, stargazers watching the Orionids can expect to see a meteor every few minutes, though in rare cases, observers have seen three times as many. Stronger activity is not expected this year, per the IMO.  The moon will be about 37 percent full on the night of October 21 and set around midnight, allowing for fairly good viewing. This year, the Orionid shower will continue until November 22, overlapping with several other showers, including the Northern Taurids, which will peak the night of November 11 to 12, and—very briefly—the Geminids.  The radiant—or the area from which these meteors appear to come—is the constellation Orion, named after the Greek hunter. The story of Orion has many different versions, but according to one myth, Orion was a mighty hunter who vowed to kill all animals on Earth. The goddess of the Earth, Gaia, was unhappy with his intention, and sent a giant scorpion after him. Though Orion tried to defeat his foe, the scorpion stung him with its poisonous tail, and he died. Out of gratitude for the arachnid, Gaia placed its figure among the stars as the constellation Scorpius. And to forever shame Orion, Gaia created his figure eternally running from the scorpion as the Earth moves through the sky.  If you’re located in the Northern Hemisphere, Orion is visible in the southwestern sky. If you’re in the Southern Hemisphere, it can be seen in the northwestern sky. The three bright stars that make up Orion’s belt are the easiest way to spot this constellation. You can also see the red supergiant star Betelgeuse in Orion's “right shoulder.” While locating the constellation Orion can be a helpful starting point, you shouldn’t stare directly at the radiant, because the meteors will appear shorter from this view. Instead, NASA recommends angling your gaze 45 to 90 degrees away from Orion for “longer and more spectacular” meteors.  Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through particles left behind by comets—or large objects made of dust and debris that orbit the sun. The Orionids are visible every year in October because of space debris left behind by Halley’s comet. Particles from this comet are also responsible for the Eta Aquarids in May.  Halley’s comet was named after English astronomer Edmond Halley (1656-1742). During Halley’s time, it was widely believed that comets only pass through our solar system once. But in 1705, the astronomer computed the orbits of several comets using Newton’s theories of gravitation and planetary motions, according to NASA. Halley found similarities in three comets reported in 1531, 1607 and 1682 that suggested they may actually be a single comet returning periodically. Halley correctly predicted the comet’s return in 1758, and it was later named Halley’s comet in his honor.  Halley’s comet orbits the sun every 75 to 76 years. The last time it could be seen from Earth was in 1986, and it will make its return in 2061.

What advice, I asked, do you have when it comes to pumpkin carving? Do you have any tricks up your sleeve to keep jack-o’-lanterns in good condition through Halloween? His tips were just as handy then as they are now, when I have two young children eager to see their pumpkins last as long as possible. Andres is a cucurbitologist. Translation: He is a pumpkin expert. And, in the first five minutes of speaking with him, the man had me convinced that the pumpkin is a work of art, even before you get to the carving. Cucurbitaceae is the family of gourds, pumpkins, watermelons and cucumbers, explained Andres, and within that family is the genus Cucurbita, his expertise. All of the pumpkins we display on our doorsteps at Halloween are from this genus, and most of them are one species. “The typical jack-o’-lantern is Cucurbita pepo,” he said. A post shared by Noel Y. Calingasan • NYC (@nyclovesnyc) Squash breeders have cultivated five species, Cucurbita pepo included, to fit our notions of the perfect pumpkin. “They have [been] bred for the thickness of the fruit stem. Wild pumpkins are very spiny plants. So, they have tried to breed out and get rid of the spininess,” said Andres. Cultivators also select for a bright orange fruit and nice, dark green stems. “That seems to attract people,” he said. When Andres carves pumpkins, he personally does not take any measures to prevent them from rotting. “It gives them character,” he said. That said, if you’d like to keep your jack-o’-lantern from slumping and growing a little fur, he does have a few tips: Also, make sure that it has no blemishes. “You don’t want them to have any frost damage,” said Andres. “You can tell that by looking at the fruit.” Watery dark spots on the top of the pumpkin are an indication of frost damage. Andres said that pumpkins tend to rot within a week or so. “But once you carve them, there are a few tricks to making them last a little bit longer.” You can squirt lemon juice on the exterior of the pumpkin, for instance. Lemon juice, as you may know, prevents the browning of fruits, such as apples and avocados (and pumpkins!). The browning is a result of phenols and enzymes in the fruits reacting with oxygen, but acidic lemon juice blocks the enzymes and thereby inhibits the reaction. Vaseline or vegetable oil can also be applied to preserve the pumpkin once it is cut.  Spray it with a bleach solution to stave off fungus growth. When outdoor temperatures stray too far from this, think about bringing your pumpkin indoors. “If you really have a prize-winning carving, and it is not too big a fruit, you could put it in the refrigerator when it is not on display,” said Andres. If the pumpkin is outside during freezing temperatures, it will thaw and inevitably rot. Master pumpkin carver Ray Villafane once turned the New York Botanical Garden’s massive pumpkins into zombies. Staff refrigerated some of the sculptures’ removable parts, at times, to keep the carvings fresh during a ten-day exhibition. “As nice as candles in jack-o’-lanterns are, they really do shorten the lifespan of the pumpkin, since the heat from the flame ends up cooking the flesh,” said Andres. “A flickering lightbulb or glow-stick can be used instead.” Get the latest Science stories in your inbox. \nMegan Gambino\n|\n\n| READ MORE\n Megan Gambino is a senior web editor for Smithsonian magazine.\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 00:00:00 GMT\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/science-nature\/six-tips-tricks-perfect-jack-o-lantern-89924662\/\",\"source\": \"smithsonianmag\",\"title\": \"Six Tips and Tricks for a Perfect Jack-O’-Lantern\"}"},

Andres, an expert in the field of gourds and related species, shared that the common jack-o’-lantern is made from Cucurbita pepo, a species that has been specifically bred to align with our ideal image of a pumpkin. This breeding has been focused on achieving a bright orange hue, a substantial fruit stem without spines, and dark green stems. \n Despite his personal preference to allow carved pumpkins to decay naturally—adding character, in his view—Andres acknowledges the desire to keep these creations intact as long as possible. For those aiming to extend the life of their jack-o’-lanterns, Andres suggested several methods. First, select a pumpkin without any blemishes or signs of frost damage, which can appear as watery dark spots. \n To prevent the browning that occurs when enzymes in the pumpkin react with oxygen—a process similar to what happens in apples and avocados—Andres recommends applying lemon juice to the cut surfaces. This acid inhibits the enzymes, thus slowing down the rotting process. Furthermore, the application of Vaseline or vegetable oil can seal the cuts, and using a bleach solution can fend off fungal growth. \n Considering that pumpkins tend to rot within a week, especially after being carved, temperature regulation becomes crucial. Andres advises that pumpkins should be kept at an ideal temperature range, and if it becomes too warm or cold outside, it may be beneficial to bring the pumpkin indoors. If you have a particularly impressive carving, and its size allows, storing it in the refrigerator when not on display can also prolong its freshness. This practice was utilized by master carver Ray Villafane, who kept parts of his pumpkin sculptures in refrigeration during a ten-day exhibition at the New York Botanical Garden. \n Lastly, Andres points out that while candles inside jack-o’-lanterns create an appealing aesthetic, the heat can cook the pumpkin flesh, thereby shortening its lifespan. An alternative light source such as a flickering bulb or a glow stick is recommended to avoid this. \n The article not only delves into the science behind pumpkin preservation but also touches upon the horticultural practices that have shaped the modern-day pumpkin to fit the cultural archetype of Halloween decorations.\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/science-nature\/six-tips-tricks-perfect-jack-o-lantern-89924662\/\",\"source\": \"smithsonianmag\",\"title\": \"Expert-Approved Techniques for a Longer-Lasting Jack-O-Lantern\"}"}

He was looking at an array of 15,000-year-old shell beads and other artifacts, which have been displayed in a case at Jerusalem’s Rockefeller Archaeological Museum since before World War II. Many people had viewed them, but Davin was struck by this detail. “If you look at it, it’s like blood, a really vivid red,” he says, “and I had to wonder, ‘What’s that color?’” Countless prehistoric artifacts are colored red with ochre, a mineral product that was the world’s first red paint, but something made this hue look very different—and Davin set out to discover what it was. Analysis with high-tech spectroscopy techniques revealed a novel source behind Davin’s suspicions. The beads, originally found in Kebara Cave, on Israel’s Mount Carmel, are the oldest known example of humans using plants to manufacture red pigment. The bright red color adorning them was produced from the roots of Rubiaceae plants, commonly known as the madder family, according to research published Wednesday in PLOS One. The creators of this 15,000-year-old paint were part of the Natufian culture. They were the first hunter-gatherers to start settling down to more sedentary lifestyles across the Levant, in what is now Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian territories. They utilized wild plants for much more than food, including processing them to make pigment, before they domesticated them. The ornamental use of these organic dyes may be an example of a growing need for expression as human societies gradually shifted over the centuries. “You try to look at your environment differently, and you have time to look at it differently, so probably over a long period of time they were looking at things like plants and animals differently and learning a lot,” says Davin, an archaeologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at a prehistoric technology laboratory at the French National Center for Scientific Research. The shell beads originated in the Mediterranean Sea—some from just 10 miles away from Mount Carmel, and some from much farther afield in the Red Sea, around 250 miles away. But many of the beads from Kebara Cave are now located even further away. British archaeologists first undertook excavations at the site in the 1930s and sent many artifacts to museum collections around the world. Previously, the earliest known examples of plant-based red pigment had appeared around 6,000 years ago. But humans—and our relatives—have long expressed ourselves with the color red, which appears to have psychological impacts on the human mind. Our ancestors produced pigments from rocks and minerals like iron oxide (which is contained in red ochre) and used them to color everything from stones and bones to cave walls—with first uses documented in Africa as far back as 500,000 years ago. Shell tooth and bone ornaments in Kebara Cave were also colored with ochre. Blocks of it were found at the cave, along with ochre-adorned artifacts such as beads and burial textiles, making it clear that this older color was still very commonly used. Davin and colleagues unearthed the pigment’s plant origins by performing several analyses. Advanced scanning studies showed no iron in the pigment, ruling out an ochre source, but showed a high carbon content that instead pointed to an organic origin. To narrow down exactly what that was, the team then used Raman spectroscopy, a chemical analysis that observes how a substance scatters light, to characterize its molecular composition. The Raman spectroscopy patterns produced by the dye were the same across all ten beads, and among possible candidate species they most closely matched signatures from compounds isolated from roots of plants from the Rubiaceae family—already known from prehistoric pollen analysis to have grown at Mount Carmel during the end of the Pleistocene period. The Natufians’ exact recipe for producing the pigment isn’t known, and Davin and his team hope to try their hand at reproducing similar substances with ancient techniques. They theorize that the Natufians dug up plants, cleaned and dried their roots, crushed them, and boiled them in water to dissolve the dye, which was then fermented. Their use of madder was a very good choice, and one that was often repeated later in history because of the outstanding color that can be produced by its roots. Red pigments made with madder have been found in King Tut’s tomb, on the Shroud of Turin and in the paintings of Vincent van Gogh. This red was a go-to up until organics were largely replaced by synthetic pigments in the 19th century. The transition from hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled agriculture wasn’t a sudden change but a long and gradual process that began with more intensive plant gathering as early as 23,000 years ago. Wild plants were also exploited and cultivated for thousands of years before they became fully domesticated and thus dependent on humans. The production of pigments is another example of how the relationships between people and plants changed, and became more intertwined, during that period. Natufian culture foragers living between 11,650 and 15,000 years ago were in the late stages of a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and extensively harvesting wild cereal plants for food. Previous research has shown that hunter-gatherers and early agriculturalists also used plants as key sources for making clothing, baskets, string and ornaments. Some of the earliest cultivar plants, like flax, were likely used primarily to make clothes. While non-food plant use was likely widespread, the hard evidence for it remains relatively scarce. Plant products and organic materials simply haven’t stood the test of time, fading away after so many thousands of years. “People weren’t just hunting animals and eating raw meat. They really were already knowing very well what plants could do and what they could use them for,” says Tobias Richter, an archaeologist at the University of Copenhagen who was not involved in the new study. Richter believes that we probably underestimate Stone Age humans’ knowledge of how to use their landscape. “I think these people were absolute experts in knowing what to do with plants,” he says. Hundreds of artifacts from Kebara Cave, including bone pendants, teeth, beads and more, were sent to museums across the United Kingdom and North America. Almost all of them, like artifacts from many other sites, have never been analyzed to see what types of plant- or animal-based pigments and dyes they might display. Using such techniques to delve into their origins could reveal much more about early relationships between humans and other species. Davin also hopes that future research will shed further light on the domestication of plants. Tools from the Kebara Cave could hold residues from processing plants, and that residue could yield genetic material. With enough samples, scientists could analyze the ancient genome and compare it to modern plants to trace the history of madder plant domestication. Beyond these species’ longstanding role as a source of pigment, their stems and leaves are still prized in the region, including in neighboring Jordan, for their antioxidant, antibacterial and even aphrodisiac qualities. To Richter, the plant-based pigments are another clear example that humans were using their imaginations to explore the resources available to them, and then used those resources creatively to elaborate their own ornamentations and rituals. “I think we tend to imagine the Stone Age past to be sort of bleak and rough and difficult to survive,” he says. “But it was also a lot more colorful and a lot more diverse than I think we often give it credit for.” Get the latest Science stories in your inbox. \nBrian Handwerk\n| READ MORE\n Brian Handwerk is a science correspondent based in Amherst, New Hampshire.\",\"date\": \"Wed, 25 Oct 2023 00:00:00 GMT\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/science-nature\/the-worlds-oldest-known-organic-paint-was-red-180983132\/\",\"source\": \"smithsonianmag\", \"title\": \"Archaeologists Find the First Red Paint Made From Plants\"}"},

And he got started early on that goal: In high school in Portland, Ore., he started a granola bar company, which helped pay for his bachelor’s degree in microbiology. After college, Walker went to work as a product manager at an instrumentation company in Washington state, planning to go to business school and then into biotech. But a class on environmental biophysics at nearby Washington State University in 2009 changed his trajectory. The course was about using mathematics to model physical systems in nature. “Working that math out to understand how energy and matter exchange within the environment,” Walker says — that was all it took. He decided to pursue a career as a plant scientist. “I wanted to have some kind of usefulness to the world,” Walker says. “Feeding people is where I settled.” Today, at Michigan State University, Walker wants to understand the intricate details of how photosynthesis works, with the ultimate aim of improving it. He remains deeply fascinated by plants: “You just take this little seed, you put it in the dirt and then you get this plant,” he says. “And it spreads these leaves out. And those leaves just take the sun, and they scrub carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, and they use that to make the food that we eat, the clothes that we wear, the air that we breathe, energy that we consume. And that’s just miraculous.” But as impressive as photosynthesis is, it is surprisingly inefficient. A leaf converts just around 1 percent of the sun’s light into usable energy, Walker says. In part that’s because of mistakes in the first step of photosynthesis. The enzyme that captures CO2 molecules and sticks them to sugar makes a lot of mistakes, often grabbing oxygen instead. Those mistakes result in a compound that actually inhibits photosynthesis. Photorespiration, a kind of recycling process, gets rid of that compound — but photorespiration requires a lot of energy. Losses due to this recycling in the American Midwest over an average wheat and soybean growing season add up to about 148 trillion dietary calories, Walker says. “If you were to convert these calories into doughnut equivalents,” he says, “you would have a stack of doughnuts that would go to the moon and back about 11 times.” Any efficiency gain could make a huge difference in agricultural productivity. But first scientists have to better understand how photorespiration works. To that end, Walker came up with an innovative technique to trace carbon molecules in leaves, research reported in a 2022 paper in Nature Plants. The researchers were using flux analysis, which reveals the movements of molecules through plants’ metabolic network. But they needed a better way to freeze the metabolism of a plant. The problem was, there was no way to spray liquid nitrogen into the instrument chamber that held the leaves. After talking to engineers at the company that makes the instrument, Walker decided to drill a hole in the chamber so his team could insert a nozzle to spray in liquid nitrogen and hit the leaf surface instantaneously. “That’s a really critical step,” says Xinyu Fu, who has been a postdoc in Walker’s lab for the past four years. A lot could change in the 10 seconds it would take to open the chamber and take the leaf out. The work revealed that up to about 40 percent of the carbon-bearing amino acid serine that is produced during photorespiration gets diverted by the plant to be used for something — perhaps protein synthesis — rather than going all the way through the recycling process. That suggests optimizing photorespiration in the context of climate change could result in more nutritious, protein-rich crops. But, “as we’re trying to change it,” Walker says, “we need to understand what trade-offs there might be.” Colleagues who know Walker best point to his eagerness to collaborate as one of his strengths, along with his generosity of spirit. Don Ort, a plant scientist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Walker’s postdoc adviser for nearly three years, says Walker is a committed teacher and colleague. “Being involved in the education of graduate students and postdocs is a passion for him,” Ort says. “He’s very passionate about what he does. He does it with a very high level of enthusiasm and a very high level of optimism. And it’s infectious to people around him.” Walker sees plant science as one big community that is trying to solve two big problems: How to make crops more productive to feed a growing population, and how to do it in a changing climate, which may pose any number of challenges to agriculture. And he believes we’ll start seeing solutions in the coming decades, whether they come out of his lab or someone else’s. “Whoever comes up with those, and if they’re shown to work and work repeatedly in a lot of crops, then that’s a really big deal,” he says. “That’s the kind of idea that we’re chasing.”\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 13:00:00 GMT\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/berkley-walker-photosynthesis-photorespiration-climate\",\"source\": \"sciencenews\", \"title\": \"Berkley Walker wants to revamp photosynthesis for a changing climate\"}"},

Initially setting his sights on the business sector, Walker’s encounter with an environmental biophysics class altered his life's direction, channeling his ambition towards improving photosynthesis and, consequently, agricultural productivity. \n At Michigan State University, Walker delves into the nuances of photosynthesis, aiming to increase its efficiency. He expresses awe at the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into sustenance and oxygen, yet he also recognizes the system's limitations. He notes that a mere 1% of the sunlight a leaf encounters is transformed into energy, with inefficiencies arising early in the process. The enzyme responsible for binding CO2 to sugar frequently errs, inadvertently binding oxygen instead, resulting in a compound that hinders photosynthesis. The subsequent corrective process, known as photorespiration, is energetically costly. \n Walker quantifies the loss from this inefficiency in stark terms: the energy wasted during an average growing season in the U.S. Midwest could be equated to a stack of doughnuts extending to the moon and back 11 times.

Researchers had only speculated as to what happened to the missing crabs. Now, a study in the Oct. 20 Science finds that a marine heat wave probably spurred a mass die-off, in part by causing crabs to starve. “It’s a fishery disaster in the truest sense of the word,” says Cody Szuwalski, a fishery biologist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle. On average, snow crabs bring in about $150 million of annual revenue for Alaskan fisheries. In the 2021-2022 crabbing season, that revenue fell to around $24 million. With marine heat waves becoming more common because of human-caused climate change, the future of such fisheries and arctic marine ecosystems, more broadly, is uncertain, researchers say (SN: 7\/13\/23). The new research can help fishery managers anticipate and prepare for similar events such as the crab collapse in the future, Szuwalski says, particularly when it comes to getting proper disaster aid to affected fishers quickly. Usually, cold, arctic water makes ideal habitat for snow crabs (Chionoecetes opilio) and other crustaceans. As winter’s thick sea ice melts, the frigid meltwater settles on the seafloor, creating a cold-water pool with temperatures below 2˚ Celsius. Crabs thrive in this chilly sanctuary on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. But a marine heat wave in the region in 2018 and 2019 prevented the usual amount of sea ice from forming, and, according to yearly temperature and population survey data, the cold pool never appeared and then the crab population collapsed. Szuwalski and colleagues used computer models to analyze temperature data combined with population surveys, fishing catch numbers and lab experiments to look for drivers behind the sudden collapse. Two causes stood out: higher water temperatures and an initially dense crab population. The water temperature probably didn’t kill the crabs directly, as snow crabs in laboratories can survive in waters up to 12° C. Instead, the crabs might have starved to death, Szuwalski says. Data show the crab population initially boomed in 2018 — reaching historic highs — thanks to ideal ocean conditions for newborn crabs around 2010. But the crabs also occupied a smaller area than normal, though Szuwalski and colleagues are uncertain why. That means more crabs were crammed onto less space on the shelf. Then came the heat wave. Higher water temperatures can rev the cold-blooded crabs’ metabolism; previous research has shown that the calorie requirements of snow crabs in labs almost double as water temperature rises from 0° to 3° C. As a result, the crowded crabs probably needed more food, but because of the smaller foraging area they had even fewer resources to sink their claws into. Compared with similar-sized crabs from the previous year, those surveyed in 2018 had lower body weights, another clue starvation played a role in the missing crabs. “It’s just yet another example of something we didn’t expect, but now we have to live with,” says Christopher Harley, a marine ecologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who was not involved with the research. In the eastern Bering Sea, it could take at least four years before more crabs of a fishable size start showing up, meaning fishers there will remain in a lurch. Such effects of marine heat waves are likely to extend beyond snow crabs. Ecosystems in northern latitudes, such as Alaska’s, are changing more rapidly in response to climate change than anywhere else (SN: 8\/11\/22). Scientists can typically use data from the past to help predict and prepare for changes in the future. But the future increasingly holds events that have never happened on record before — like the snow crab population collapse — so they’re harder to prepare for, Harley says. That’s especially true, he says, because there hasn’t been enough attention on the secondary effects of marine heat waves on cold-blooded creatures, such as higher calorie needs and the risk of starvation.\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 13:00:00 GMT\", \"link\": \"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/10-billion-snow-crabs-disappeared-alaska\",\"source\": \"sciencenews\", \"title\": \"10 billion snow crabs have disappeared off the Alaskan coast.

This decline has been linked to a marine heat wave that is suspected of causing mass starvation among the crabs, as per the findings published in the journal Science on October 20. The heat wave prevented the formation of the cold pool, an essential habitat for the crabs, by limiting the formation of sea ice. \n Cody Szuwalski, a fishery biologist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center, described the situation as a “fishery disaster,” highlighting the severe economic impact, with revenue dropping from about $150 million annually to around $24 million during the 2021-2022 crabbing season. The increasing frequency of marine heat waves due to human-induced climate change is casting uncertainty on the future of Arctic marine ecosystems and fisheries. \n Snow crabs typically thrive in cold Arctic waters beneath melting sea ice. However, the 2018 and 2019 heat wave led to abnormally high temperatures that disrupted this environment. Szuwalski and his team used computer models, which incorporated temperature and population survey data, fishing catch numbers, and lab experiments, to analyze potential causes for the crab population collapse. They found that the combination of higher temperatures and an unusually high crab population density in a restricted area likely led to the die-off. The crabs, being cold-blooded, faced increased metabolic rates due to warmer waters, doubling their caloric needs, which, in the face of limited foraging space, may have led to widespread starvation. \n The study also showed that before the heat wave, the crab population had reached a historic high in 2018 due to favorable ocean conditions for juvenile crabs around 2010. However, these same crabs were later found to have lower body weights, suggesting that starvation was a significant factor in their demise. \n Christopher Harley, a marine ecologist at the University of British Columbia, pointed out that such unexpected events are becoming more common due to climate change, and they are difficult to predict and prepare for, especially since the secondary effects on ectothermic (cold-blooded) creatures are not well-understood. It is anticipated that it may take at least four years before the snow crab population in the eastern Bering Sea rebounds to a size that is fishable, indicating prolonged economic hardship for the region's fishers.\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023\", \"link\": \"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/10-billion-snow-crabs-disappeared-alaska\",\"source\": \"sciencenews\",\"title\": \"Climate Crisis: Alaskan Snow Crab Population Collapses\"}"}

The state broadly tracks its sources of air pollution, from energy production to transportation to waste management, but the books don’t always match what’s actually in the air. The amount of methane over New York City, for example, is puzzlingly higher than expected. It’s a mystery that Róisín Commane is trying to solve. Part accountant, part sleuth, the Columbia University atmospheric chemist scours the city from pavement to rooftop looking for unidentified or incorrectly cataloged sources of greenhouse gases — and uses this information to improve our understanding of the city’s anthropogenic emissions. There are two primary strategies to quantify emissions. Bottom-up models calculate total pollution from individual sources using representative values for each type of emissions. Top-down models describe total pollution moving through an area using measurements taken directly from tower sensors or planes. The challenge lies in reconciling the two, Commane says. “These models can be tweaked to make sure that they represent the atmosphere as we understand it now.” It’s important work. Urban areas account for about 70 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions, and among cities in the United States, New York City is the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. A better accounting of greenhouse gas emissions could help New York reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050 and assess how well its reduction efforts are working, Commane says. “We all have great intentions, but if we can show it’s reducing emissions, that’s a much more tangible thing.” And the findings in New York City could inform similar efforts elsewhere, especially in places with comparable natural gas infrastructure. Commane compares atmospheric modeling to solving a complicated puzzle. “I’ve always enjoyed playing with numbers,” she says. After studying chemistry and mathematical physics at University College Dublin in Ireland, Commane got a Ph.D. in atmospheric chemistry at the University of Leeds in England. There, she learned to build tools that measure atmospheric gases, including laser systems. Atmospheric scientist Steven Wofsy, who advised Commane while she was a research associate at Harvard University, praises her ability to “think about problems holistically.” She’s very creative, he says, pointing to work she did on Arctic carbon. Many existing models focused solely on the summer growing season, when carbon uptake from photosynthesis is at its peak. But Commane extended her experiment to include the winter months, when the ground layer finally freezes and soil microbes that break down and release organic matter as carbon become dormant. Commane found that, in warmer years, delays in Arctic freezing could lead to enough soil emissions to offset summer uptake and turn the tundra into a net source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The work in the Arctic is “slightly depressing” because “things are thawing very quickly up there,” Commane says. “The Arctic is suffering from what we’re emitting down here.” Moving to Columbia University in 2018 to start her own lab gave Commane the opportunity to help address emissions at their source. In addition to New York City’s status as the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, it ranks third worldwide. She started by characterizing the city’s greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. In collaboration with scientists from the City University of New York, Stony Brook University and the University of Rochester, she developed a network of monitors to sample gases around the city and state. She also noticed how verdant the city was. New York City is home to an estimated 7 million trees, yet vegetation is left out from most of the city’s carbon accounting models, Commane says. Commane wondered whether the trees might help explain why carbon emissions measured in the atmosphere were slightly lower than what the bottom-up models predicted. Using the latest high-resolution land cover maps to incorporate vegetation into their model, she and Dandan Wei, a postdoc in her lab, found that the city’s trees were absorbing a surprisingly large amount of carbon dioxide during the afternoon, about 40 percent of the city’s emissions on a summer’s day. “So the trees do really matter,” Commane says, and models need to account for them. Otherwise, attempts to measure total emissions from human activity in the atmosphere would miss the chunk of carbon that is temporarily taken up by the trees. As for methane, levels in the air above the city are at least three times as high as those predicted by bottom-up models. But no one knows what causes the excess. To figure that out, Commane looks for methane relative to other gases, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and ethane. When the sensors pick up large plumes of gas, Commane uses a technique called source attribution to determine how the plumes were produced. Wind speed and plume intensity provide information about the direction to and distance from the source. Then it’s a matter of hopping into a car or going on foot to measure and confirm the exact location of the emissions with portable sensors, Commane says. So far, her group has attributed a surprisingly large amount of the unaccounted-for methane to chimneys and rooftops. These are likely due to incomplete combustion of natural gas associated with building heating systems. The researchers also detected localized spikes of methane around certain equipment in now-closed landfills, which could be reduced through engineering solutions that prevent leakage. The largest signals came from older wastewater treatment plants, Commane says, but on the bright side, refurbished facilities barely produced any methane at all. “The ground-truthing that Dr. Commane is doing is really important,” says Ellen Burkhard, a senior adviser at the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, the state agency that funds this part of Commane’s research. “By making these measurements in a sophisticated way, repeatedly, we can characterize the source and [how] that source may change over time,” Burkhard says. “It’s sort of the old adage: You can’t manage what you don’t measure.” Though Commane continues to work on other projects, she finds the partnership between her lab and the energy research agency particularly rewarding because it’s so solutions-oriented. It keeps her realistic but hopeful in the fight against climate change. “If we didn’t have a way of trying to help fix things, it would feel a lot more futile,” she says. “Here, I can do something about it. And that makes a big difference, I think.”\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 13:00:00 GMT\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/greenhouse-gas-climate-change-roisin-commane-scientists-to-watch\",\"source\": \"sciencenews\",\"title\": \"Róisín Commane sleuths out greenhouse gas leaks to fight climate change\"}"},

Commane employs both bottom-up and top-down models to measure emissions. Bottom-up models estimate emissions from individual sources, while top-down models track pollution through an area based on direct atmospheric measurements. \n Commane's work in atmospheric modeling is a mix of number crunching and investigative fieldwork, and she has brought innovation to the field with her comprehensive approach to problems. Notably, during her Ph.D. at the University of Leeds, she built tools to measure atmospheric gases. Her holistic approach to problem-solving was also demonstrated in her Arctic carbon studies at Harvard University under the mentorship of atmospheric scientist Steven Wofsy.

Her research has uncovered that trees in the city absorb a significant amount of CO2, particularly on summer afternoons, which had been omitted from most carbon accounting models. This finding suggests that urban vegetation plays a more critical role in carbon absorption than previously acknowledged. \n Methane levels in New York are also a point of concern, being at least three times higher than bottom-up models predict. Commane is identifying the sources of this excess methane by analyzing its presence relative to other gases and then physically locating the emission sources.

Now, a second, updated report shows that many amphibians are still in trouble, but with some silver linings, researchers report October 4 in Nature. “We are realistic and hopeful at the same time,” says Jennifer Luedtke, a conservationist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which tracks extinction risk trends for species around the world. In particular, the wealth of data in the new report, which includes about 8,000 amphibian species, could help focus conservation efforts for years to come, says Luedtke, who also works from Washington, D.C., for Re:wild, a conservation organization based in Austin, Texas. That’s what happened after the first Global Amphibian Assessment in 2004, which brought awareness to the amphibian crisis and galvanized researchers to coordinate efforts. Having two assessments that can be compared is a big deal, experts say. “It’s important not just to have a picture, but actually to have a sequence of pictures … where you can see what’s happening over time,” says conservation ecologist Ana Rodrigues of CNRS in Montpelier, France, who worked on the first assessment but was not involved in the second. “I’m really happy to see this done.” Here are five big takeaways from the new report. About 41 percent of amphibian species, which include frogs, toads and salamanders, are threatened with extinction, Luedtke and her colleagues found. That’s more than any other group of vertebrates, beating out sharks and rays (37 percent), mammals (27 percent), reptiles (21 percent) and birds (13 percent). Amphibians held this title in 2004 too, when 39 percent of species were threatened. As part of the 2022 update, researchers also used data to reconstruct the situation in 1980. They found that even in 1980, that number was already high, at 38 percent. Basically, amphibians have been really threatened for a really long time, Luedtke says. The most common threat that affects amphibians is habitat loss and degradation, with agriculture affecting as many as 77 percent of the studied species. Other threats include climate change and disease, each affecting 29 percent of species. Of course, “these things are never completely isolated,” says Rodrigues, and each threat may increase the likelihood of other threats. Luedtke and colleagues also wanted to know which threats were most responsible for driving the worst declines. So they looked at a subset of 482 species that, from 1980 and 2004, moved down an IUCN Red List status level — for instance, from vulnerable to endangered. They found that disease was the primary driver behind the drop in conservation status for 58 percent of that species subset. At the time, the fungal pathogen chytrid was devastating frog populations around the world (SN: 8\/23\/02). Climate change, on the other hand, was a significant contributor to declines in only 1 percent of species. Now, less than 20 years later, climate change is behind a status drop for 39 percent of species, according to an analysis of 306 species whose status declined from 2004 to 2022. That makes it the most common primary driver of declines across the amphibian group, the researchers found. And still the finding is probably an underestimate, Luedtke says, as studies continue to emerge detailing how climate change–related temperature increases, changes in precipitation, extreme weather events and wildfires impact amphibians. “It’s very worrying,” Rodrigues says. “We’re at the beginning of climate change.… What’s ahead of us?” Each region faces its own set of threats. The chytrid outbreak, for example, has affected much of the world, but it hit Central and South America especially hard from the 1970s to the 2000s. That likely explains why that region contains the largest proportion of species in the IUCN Red List categories of highest concern, the researchers say. New Guinea and Africa were spared much of the devastation, though the pathogen has recently started to emerge in sub-Saharan Africa. Across Europe and East Asia, habitat loss is the leading cause of decline, followed by a newly emerging fungal pathogen in Europe called Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, this time that affects salamanders (SN: 9\/3\/13). It hasn’t yet spread to North America, which would be disastrous, Rodrigues says. The continent is home to more than 200 types of salamanders, over a quarter of the world’s salamander species. For now, North America’s amphibian declines are most associated with climate change, the report found. South and Southeast Asia are seeing an improving trend among their species’ extinction risk, probably due to better management of protected areas. One of the assessment’s few bright spots is its sheer amount of data. The update includes more than 2,000 additional species — all newly described since 2004. There was also a decrease in species labeled as “data deficient” by the IUCN, from 23 percent in 2004 to only 11 percent in 2022. By comparison, though, less than 1 percent of bird species are listed as data deficient. While there’s still a long way to go for amphibians, researchers are thrilled by the new amount of information. “It’s like, wow, all the knowledge!” Rodrigues says. “So that’s absolutely good news.” With more data, she says, conservation efforts can be better focused. The new report didn’t just find declines — 120 species saw their IUCN conservation status improve. About half of those species recovered unaided. Many of those had suffered declines due to chytrid and are now bouncing back, possibly as frogs become resistant to the pathogen (SN: 3\/29\/18). It’s a source of hope that “we have these little frogs evolving, in front of our eyes, resistance to chytridiomycosis,” Luedtke says. The other half improved thanks to conservation efforts, the report found. One of those species is India’s indigo bush frog (Raorchestes indigo), which was classified as critically endangered in 2004. A couple years later, a legal battle led to the end of all mining in the Kudremukh Massif mountain range, and the species’ IUCN status has since improved to vulnerable. Stories like that are evidence that effective habitat protection can make a noticeable difference, the researchers say, and yet, with most amphibians still facing declines, it’s clear that current efforts are not enough. The assessment’s accompanying State of the World’s Amphibians Report focuses on action steps based on the new findings. Among other things, it identifies 50 target conservation areas around the world — including Jamaica, Brazil’s Atlantic Forest and the Central Annamite Highlands in Vietnam — that feature a high density of threatened species. “Yes, the number of threatened amphibians continues to increase, but our understanding is improving,” Luedtke says. “And because we understand them better, we can act in a more accurate and effective way.”\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 13:00:00 GMT\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/amphibian-frog-extinction-risk-climate-global-report\", \"source\": \"sciencenews\",\"title\": \"A global report finds amphibians are still in peril.

        {"role": "user", "content": "{ \"_id\":\"653ebc93db4cb73d3b09223a\",\"author\": \"Carolyn Gramling\", \"category\": \"science\",\"content\": \"For decades, scientists have vigorously debated whether an asteroid strike or massive volcanic eruptions ended the reign of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Roughly three-quarters of all life on Earth, including all nonbird dinosaurs, went extinct at that time, putting a dramatic end to the Cretaceous Period. Now, researchers have devised a new way to identify the true dino killer: Let computers take a crack at it. The result of that computational effort suggests that massive bursts of gas produced by the Deccan Traps eruptions were solely capable of causing the extinction event, the team reports in the Sept. 29 Science. Those eruptions, which lasted roughly a million years, spewed massive amounts of gas-ridden lava across what’s now western India. “Rather than come at it from the perspective of ‘let’s blame the volcanoes and explain why’ or ‘let’s blame asteroids and explain why,’” the goal was to have as little human input or bias in the process as possible, says Dartmouth computational geologist Alexander Cox. The idea was to work backward using evidence from the scene of the crime. Scientists do have a smoking gun: Cores drilled into deep-ocean sediments contain geologic data pointing to deadly bursts of gas to the atmosphere, particularly planet-warming carbon dioxide and ocean-acidifying sulfur dioxide. But such gases could have come from the asteroid strike, as it incinerated rocks on the planet’s surface, Cox says, or from the Deccan Traps eruptions. Previous efforts to understand the source of the gases have focused on timing, examining pulses of lava emplacement during the Deccan Traps eruptions, Cox says (SN: 2\/21\/19). But “we only have best guesses about how much initial gas was in [the lava].” Estimated carbon dioxide concentrations in the lava, for example, vary by an order of magnitude, he says. “So that’s why we approached this from a gas-emissions perspective rather than a lava-flow perspective.” To disentangle the relative contributions of each potential culprit, Cox and Dartmouth geologist C. Brenhin Keller used a statistical model called a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. That approach systematically considers the probability of different scenarios of gas emissions from the different sources, converging toward possible solutions as the results of the simulations move closer and closer to geologic observations. What made the researchers’ approach particularly powerful is that they harnessed 128 different processors to run scenarios in parallel, Cox says. “All the processors then compared how they’re doing at the end of every model run, like classmates comparing answers.” That parallel computing meant that computations that would otherwise have taken a year took only a few days. The observations Cox and Keller used were data collected from three cores drilled into deep-sea sediments, each spanning 67 million to 65 million years ago. In those sediments are foraminifera, ocean-dwelling microorganisms whose carbonate shells contain different isotopes, or forms, of carbon and oxygen. The shells’ chemical makeup records the ocean chemistry at the time of their formation, and so can be used as a proxy to infer past global temperatures as well as how many creatures were thriving in the oceans, and how much carbon was moving between the atmosphere, ocean and land (SN: 1\/16\/20). The computer simulations determined that the amount of gas spewed into the atmosphere from the volcanism alone was enough to account for the changes in temperature and carbon cycling determined from the foraminifera data in the drill cores. As for the asteroid strike, which formed the massive Chicxulub crater in what’s now Mexico, it probably did not produce a big spike in carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide, the analysis found (SN: 1\/25\/17). But many scientists are not convinced that these findings provide the ultimate answer to this long-standing, complex question. “It’s an elegant way to address this problem,” says Sierra Petersen, a geochemist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Modeling in this way “gives the freedom to find the consensus solution, taking multiple proxy records into account. However, like any model, output depends on input.” Petersen notes that foraminifera shells are not an ideal proxy for ancient temperatures: The oxygen isotope ratios in foraminifera shells can change not only due to temperature but also due to seawater composition. Different temperature proxies would likely lead to different patterns of gas release reproduced in models, Petersen says. As for the mass extinction culprit, she adds, “it’s a bit of a leap to say that this study shows the impact didn’t cause the extinction. I think what they show is that the impact was likely not associated with a large [gas] release.” But the asteroid, she says, still could have had other deadly impacts on the planet’s environment. Indeed, “the Chicxulub impact led to many devastating effects beyond the carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions explored in this study,” says Clay Tabor, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. Those include massive clouds of soot and dust kicked up from pulverized rocks due to the impact, he says. Previous research has suggested this dust may have dimmed the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth by as much as 20 percent, inducing a frigid winter that swiftly killed off plants and destroyed habitats (SN: 7\/17\/20). What’s more, the new study suggests that the asteroid impact didn’t have a long-term effect on the planet’s carbon cycle, based on carbon isotope data recorded in the foraminifera shells for the million years after the extinction. But there was an abrupt drop in the abundance of those creatures corresponding to the time of the impact, Tabor says. “The rapid rate of change caused by the Chicxulub impact was likely responsible for its effects on life.” “Many geochemical records spanning the [extinction event], as well as this modeling work, cannot capture well the rates of change associated with the Chicxulub impact,” he says. “The impact may have released significantly less CO2 and SO2 than the Deccan Traps, but it did so almost instantaneously.” So even if the asteroid impact released fewer gases overall, Tabor says, the speediness of that release could have been devastating all the same.\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023 13:00:00 GMT\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/new-computer-volcanism-killed-dinosaurs-asteroid\", \"source\": \"sciencenews\",\"title\": \"New computer analysis hints volcanism killed the dinosaurs, not an asteroid\"}"},

Furthermore, Clay Tabor from the University of Connecticut highlights the rapid and destructive effects of the asteroid impact, such as soot and dust clouds leading to a drastic drop in sunlight and temperatures on Earth. \n The study underscores the complexities in pinpointing the exact causes of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. It suggests that while the volcanic activities of the Deccan Traps were capable of altering the climate and ecological balance to the point of mass extinction, the asteroid's role, particularly its immediate and rapid environmental effects, cannot be entirely ruled out.\",\"date\": \"Fri, 27 Oct 2023\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/new-computer-volcanism-killed-dinosaurs-asteroid\",\"source\": \"sciencenews\",\"title\": \"Volcanic Activity, Not Asteroid, May Have Doomed Dinosaurs\" }"}

Plastic alternatives or recycling, for instance, is the go-to thing for people who want to get into sustainability. This thinking is further supported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports and pundits who suggest that consumers can reduce 40% to 70% of projected 2050 emissions by shifting to locally grown food, avoiding flights, and choosing to walk or bike instead of driving cars. It implies that the responsibility lies with consumers and emphasizes transportation as the main concern. This is an unrealistic expectation. Significant shifts in consumer behavior can take decades. And it’s poking at the wrong beast. We must focus instead on disruption and innovation in industry sectors with the greatest capacity to make progress on decarbonization. But you cannot expect big industries to change overnight. You also cannot expect them to trust new technologies, particularly if those increase their capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx). There is only one way that brown-field industries will ever adopt green practices and technologies, and that’s through superior unit economics.  \n\n\t\t\tWe must focus instead on disruption and innovation in industry sectors with the greatest capacity to make progress on decarbonization.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Many consumers might pay a “green premium” for eco-friendly products like clothes or coffee, but businesses are far more price sensitive. And that’s who these climate tech companies are selling to — legacy industries already seeing their margins squeezed by other factors like commodity pricing and supply chain costs. So, incurring higher costs for green solutions is not an option. This is particularly true in sectors that rely on resource- or energy-intensive processes, like steel, cement, and agriculture, which are sectors with some of the greatest potential for decarbonization: While the long-term benefits of sustainability might be evident, immediate financial pressures take precedence in decision-making. This is why green premium products won’t scale. And this challenge is exacerbated when these solutions clash with fundamental limitations of physics. What do I mean by that? Let’s talk about the senseless economics of direct air carbon capture (DAC) systems that suck CO2 directly out of the atmosphere. Investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) has more than doubled since 2022 to hit a record high of $6.4 billion, with most of the capital going into DAC. One that got a lot of attention is building a direct air capture plant that will reduce 800 cars’ worth of emissions a year. The cost of the plant is $15 million. Do the math: There are roughly 1.4 billion cars on the planet. To offset and capture the CO2 emissions from all of those cars, it would cost us $20 quadrillion. Not $20 billion, not $20 trillion. $20 quadrillion. And, by the way, passenger cars are responsible for just 5% of global carbon emissions. So this will never scale to the point where it can have an actual impact. Direct air carbon capture might be cool to talk about, and visualize, but it is just not economically viable. CO2 in the air is so diluted that trying to capture it is a fight against entropy. On the other hand, trees are cheap and self-powered by the sun. Leaning into nature-based solutions, like ecosystem restoration and increasing forest stock, is the wiser choice. When evaluating early-stage deals in climate tech, we always consider: And we never rely on economic modeling when scientific and physical measurement can be done instead. If the technology is truly disruptive, it solves the problem in a way that is so compelling it wipes out the previous way of doing things. To feel ultra-secure, we test it with potential customers to see how motivating the better unit economics are. Let’s use this lens on another hyped-up climate technology: green hydrogen. Electrolysers require more energy to produce a molecule of hydrogen than the energy held in this same molecule of hydrogen. As a result, green hydrogen is 2x to 3x more expensive than “gray” hydrogen. And we’re far from solving this cost issue. Without lower costs, industries and consumers will never adopt hydrogen as a fuel at scale. Yet VC investments in green hydrogen companies have skyrocketed the last few years, from less than $200 million in 2020 to over $3 billion in 2022. Let’s go back to where we started: plastic. Recycling plastic is a fight against entropy. The reverse logistics cost of collecting plastic waste from dispersed locations (scattered across billions of households) outweighs the cost of virgin plastic. Recycling metals, on the other hand, does make sense. Companies that can easily collect end-of-life lithium-ion batteries and turn them into new EV batteries are worth their weight in lithium, so to speak. Investors need to focus on the wide-chain economics for any solution they are considering. And they must focus on those that are at least at cost parity with incumbent technologies to make it a no-brainer for adoption. This is about stacking up financial wins side by side with decarbonization, creating a compelling incentive for widespread adoption by industries. It’s the only way climate tech investments will pay off, provide real returns, and, therefore, have a long-lasting impact.\",\"date\": \"Sun, 29 Oct 2023 00:00:00 GMT\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/10\/25\/as-a-climate-tech-investor-unit-economics-is-the-only-thing-i-care-about\/\", \"source\": \"techcrunch\",\"title\": \"As a climate tech investor, unit economics is the only thing I care about\"}"},

The narrative, buoyed by IPCC reports and environmental pundits, centers on the belief that consumer choices—such as adopting local diets, avoiding air travel, and using bicycles over cars—can dramatically cut projected 2050 emissions by 40% to 70%. This places a significant burden of climate action on individuals and points to transportation as a critical area for change. However, this perspective might be overlooking a more significant piece of the puzzle. \n The true leverage for climate impact lies in targeting industrial sectors with the most potential for decarbonization. Industries like steel, cement, and agriculture present enormous opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But expecting these sectors to adopt greener practices merely out of environmental concern is unrealistic. High capital and operational costs often accompany such changes, and industries, inherently averse to higher expenses, will not adopt new technologies unless they offer better unit economics. \n Businesses typically resist paying a 'green premium' for eco-friendly solutions, particularly when other financial pressures loom large, such as commodity pricing and supply chain costs. This economic resistance is evident in the struggle of direct air carbon capture (DAC) technology to scale. While investment in DAC and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies has surged, hitting $6.4 billion, the sheer cost of DAC—demonstrated by the $15 million price tag for a plant offsetting the emissions of merely 800 cars—casts doubt on its viability. Considering the global scale of emissions from vehicles, which constitute only a fraction of total emissions, the economics of DAC do not add up. \n The focus, then, might need to shift towards more economically feasible and nature-based solutions, like reforestation and ecosystem restoration, which offer more attractive cost propositions. The same economic reality check applies to green hydrogen, which, despite the hype and significant venture capital investment, remains more expensive than traditional 'gray' hydrogen. Without a solution to its cost problem, its adoption at scale remains unlikely. \n In contrast, recycling certain materials like metals from lithium-ion batteries presents a more favorable economic case. Here, the recycling process is not only environmentally beneficial but also economically viable, indicating a sustainable model for investment. \n The overarching message is clear: climate tech investments need to be scrutinized for not only their environmental impact but also their economic practicality. Investors are advised to consider technologies that offer cost parity with existing solutions, ensuring that adoption by industries isn't hindered by financial disincentives. Only by aligning economic benefits with environmental goals can we ensure that sustainable technologies are adopted widely and have a meaningful impact on the climate.\",\"date\": \"Sun, 29 Oct 2023 00:00:00 GMT\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/10\/25\/as-a-climate-tech-investor-unit-economics-is-the-only-thing-i-care-about\/\",\"source\": \"techcrunch\",\"title\": \"Unit Economics: The Driving Force for Climate Tech Investments\"}"}

The combination captures energy from the sun more efficiently than traditional silicon cells, creating powerful solar panels. That sounds simple enough, but designing an efficient perovskite silicon tandem solar cell isn’t easy because of its multi-layer architecture. A Singapore-based company called Cosmos Innovation is making the process more efficient by using AI to optimize the design of perovskite silicon tandem solar cells and is using its tech to build a self-learning fab. Cosmos exited stealth today with $19.7 million in total funding, including a seed round of $2.88 million raised in 2020 and a Series A of $16.8 million from earlier this year. Its Series A was led by Xora Innovation, the early-stage deep tech investment platform of Temasek. Participants included Innovation Endeavors, the venture firm co-founded by Eric Schmidt; Two Sigma Ventures; DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis; MIT professor Tomaso Poggio; natural language processing researcher, You.com CEO and AIX Ventures managing partner Richard Socher; and Western Technology Investments. Cosmos relies on Mobius, its AI recipe optimization platform, to accelerate the development of its solar cells. Created by Cosmos, Mobius has been used in sectors including solar, silicon carbide, advanced data center chips and advanced packaging. It is key to Cosmos’ ambition to create the world’s first self-learning fab in the solar and semiconductor space. Instead of manual, trial-and-error based processes, Mobius uses AI to speed the experimental design, test and iteration loop of semiconductors. The startup was founded in 2020 by CEO Vijay Chandrasekhar and CTO Joel Li. Before Cosmos, Chandrasekhar led an AI effort at the Institute for Infocomm Research, part of the Agency of Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), where he oversaw 150 people and managed a portfolio of AI projects with a focus on semiconductors. Li was former group head at the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore and served as an AI team lead at A*STAR, leading the development of AI solutions for manufacturers and R&D institutes. The two met while at A*STAR. Cosmos Innovation founders Joel Li and Vijay Chandrasekhar Cosmos Innovation founders Joel Li and Vijay Chandrasekhar When asked to explain perovskite silicon tandem solar cell technology in layperson’s terms, Chandrasekhar and Li said that it replaces conventional solar cells currently on the market. Conventional solar cells use silicon to absorb light. When layered on top of silicon, perovskite, a crystal that occurs in nature or is manmade, captures different parts of the solar spectrum. That makes it more efficient than conventional solar cells. “The big, big, big market opportunity is because silicon technology is reaching its fundamental limits,” said Chandrasekhar. “There’s a big trillion-dollar opportunity going into the 2030s and we wanted to drive the next S curve in solar, which is perovskite silicon tandem.” Some of the challenges researchers have to solve before perovskite silicon tandem solar cell tech can be commercialized include stability and scaling up the technology, says Li. There are three main market segments for perovskite silicon tandem solar cell tech. The first are residential rooftop panels. Then there’s commercial and industrial, or panels placed on top of facilities and warehouses. The third one is power plants that generate electricity and feed it into the grid. Cosmos’ founders say one of the advantages of perovskite silicon tandem solar cell tech is that it takes less space, since it is more efficient. “Every bit of efficiency is going to move the needle massively on the amount of electricity you can generate,” said Chandrasekhar. “Perovskite silicon tandem is disruptive to silicon in these area-constrained applications.” Perovskite silicon tandem tech’s multi-layer architecture means it is more difficult to design, with many different variations. As a result, researchers need to spend a lot of time figuring out the best recipe for peak cell efficiency and stability. Mobius is meant to take a lot of the guesswork out of this process and make it less labor-intensive to create cost-effective and high-efficiency solar cells by figuring out the right combination of materials, processes and architecture. The company claims it has already seen a 10x acceleration in process recipes, along with improvements in target performance with top semiconductor companies. Cosmos worked on 10 different problems with leading semiconductor and solar companies (their names can’t be disclosed) and Li says “we’ve shown time and time again our AI technology can accelerate process optimization.” It’s been used on applications like solar silicone carbide, front-end transistors and chiplets. Chandrasekhar says Mobius is Cosmos’ key to setting itself apart from competitors in the perovskite silicon tandem space, like Oxford PV and CubicPV, which is backed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “At this point, there is an arms race to build this technology. This is the single most disruptive shift in solar since the first silicon solar cell was invented in Bell Labs 50 years ago,” he says. “There’s an arms race and big platform shift, which enables new startups like us to enter the race. There’s a group of perovskite silicon tandem startups and of course the big incumbents are also looking into it.” But Chandrasekhar added that Cosmos’ advantage is that the company began as an AI company and then decided to build next-generation semiconductors. Cosmos’ funding is being used to accelerate its R&D process. Its go-to-market strategy focuses on its initial pilot customers and the premium end of the market, including area-constrained applications. It is currently building early prototypes. Cosmos is also working on its self-learning fab, which Chandrasekhar describes as Mobius layered on top of hardware, and is already running in Singapore. In a quote about the investment, Xora Innovation managing director Phil Inagaki said, “Cosmos Innovation has assembled some of the world’s leading minds in AI, semiconductor manufacturing and solar to create Mobius — the first AI platform that enables self-learning fabrication of complex silicon devices. The application of Mobius to perovskite silicon tandem solar cells promises to deliver more cost-effective, reliable and efficient modules on an accelerated timeline.”\",\"date\": \"Sat, 28 Oct 2023 00:00:00 GMT\",\"link\": \"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/10\/19\/cosmosinnovation\/\",\"source\": \"techcrunch\", \"title\": \"Temasek’s Xora backs Cosmos Innovation’s next-generation solar cell technology\" }"},

Then came Hawaii’s deadly firestorm this year. Camp, Dixie and Lahaina aren’t just three of the deadliest, most destructive wildfires in U.S. history; they are also all caused by downed power lines or faulty equipment owned by electric companies. Utilities have long known about the hazards posed by trees growing close to power lines, but the successive disasters threw the issue into sharp relief. Wildfire risk isn’t just a problem for utilities in California or Hawaii. It’s a concern anywhere there has historically been a strong fire regime, where climate patterns and evolution have created the right conditions. It’s also a growing issue in a range of ecosystems that are now threatened with the possibility of catastrophic fire thanks to climate change. Three years ago, when it was becoming clear that wildfire risk was here to stay for utilities, Indra den Bakker and his colleagues at Overstory heard from a utility in Europe. At the time, Overstory specialized in identifying forest cover in satellite images and tracking how it changed over time. The idea for the company was borne out of a competition sponsored by Planet to see who could most accurately monitor deforestation in the Amazon. “Our initial customer base was a little bit more horizontal with more data-as-a-service. We were serving the forest industry, an NGO, a bank as a customer,” said den Bakker, who is co-founder and CEO of the startup. After a few years, the company knew it was time to focus. At the time, “one utility came to us and said, ‘You know a lot about trees. We have a big issue with trees.’ That was new to us,” he told TechCrunch+. “The moment we learned about the market, about their problems, I think the more strongly we felt like this is a problem we can help solve.” Today, Overstory is entirely focused on the utility market, with 90% of its customers in North America. “It’s more about focus and where do we spend our time,” den Bakker said. That’s not surprising given that utilities on the continent have likely been spooked by PG&E’s bankruptcy, its billions in debt related to the fire, and the 84 counts of manslaughter it pleaded guilty to as a result of the Camp Fire that leveled the town of Paradise, California.

This correlation has brought to the forefront the dangers of inadequate vegetation management around power lines, a well-known risk factor within the utility sector. \n These concerns are not confined to areas traditionally associated with wildfires but are becoming increasingly relevant across diverse ecosystems due to climate change. Indra den Bakker, co-founder and CEO of Overstory, explains how his company, initially focusing on forest monitoring via satellite imagery, pivoted towards addressing this very issue.

The Elon Musk–owned automaker is urging the Biden administration to adopt tougher fuel economy standards than regulators have proposed, a move that is likely to irritate legacy automakers like General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. Collectively, those three companies face a combined $10.5 billion in noncompliance fines from 2027 to 2032 under the proposed standards and have already urged regulators to ease up. Tesla’s call on regulators to double down is another way for the company to one-up its competitors. GM, Ford and Stellantis are embroiled in a bitter union strike that has already cost them $3.45 billion and will affect their rollout of electric vehicles. And as strike costs mount, these automakers appear to be dealing with softening demand for their EVs, which are priced at a premium. Tesla’s workforce is non-unionized and it only produces electric vehicles, so the company stands to gain from both the strikes and stricter fuel standards. And Tesla might just need the boost if it wants to continue to dominate the EV market share in the U.S. The company has been slashing its car prices to boost sales. And while Tesla delivered a record number of vehicles in the third quarter this year, its market share is down 10 points from a year ago. In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Tesla said the agency should finalize rules to increase the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards by 6% annually for passenger cars and 8% annually for trucks and SUVs. That’s up from the NHTSA’s proposal of 2% for cars and 4% for trucks and SUVs, which would reach an average fleet fuel economy of 58 miles per gallon by 2032. Tesla argues its own proposals would “significantly reduce energy consumption, mitigate climate change, and appropriately recognize the increasing marketplace adoption of BEV technology in both the light-duty and [heavy-duty pickup truck] sectors.” That last part is important. One of the main themes throughout Tesla’s letter to the NHTSA is that the agency doesn’t correctly consider the current and projected market penetration of EVs. Tesla writes that numerous manufacturers — like Toyota, Hyundai, JLR and Subaru — have announced EV production goals that fall within the timeframe of the proposed standard, and highlighted the over $115 billion that automakers and battery makers have committed to expand EV and battery production in North America. “EVs represent 9.1 percent of new light-duty vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2023,” reads the letter. “Continuing this rapid growth has led to estimates that by 2024 every third commercially newly registered car could be an electric vehicle.” Tesla also calls NHTSA out for leaving out future vehicle models, like the Cybertruck pickup, from its modeling. The rollout of the futuristic-looking pickup truck has been long delayed, but Tesla said it expects to begin deliveries of the Cybertruck later this year. The EV maker appears to have shared with the NHTSA how many vehicles it will deliver this year and its plans for production ramp up in order. That information was redacted from the published version of the letter, but it’s clear Tesla thinks it can produce enough so that the heavy-duty pickup truck standards it suggested will by “technologically feasible” by 2024. The NHTSA’s proposal also includes a note to reduce “off-cycle credits,” which allow automakers to earn credits for adopting technologies that improve the real-world fuel efficiency of their vehicles beyond what the CAFE standard tests measure. Things like improved air-conditioning systems and advanced engine stop-start systems that shut off the engine when the vehicle is stopped. Tesla says the NHTSA should take those things off the table entirely. “Even if reduced, the continuing of off-cycle crediting creates asymmetry in the regulation favoring ICE vehicles, diverts research and development investment away from the best emissions reduction technology of electrification, and unnecessarily weakens the stringency of the standard,” writes Tesla. Throughout the letter, Tesla peppered its humble brags about its own technological capabilities with reminders that its suggested fuel standards would result in better climate outcomes. And indeed, harsher fuel standards would result in fewer emissions, but only if automakers are able to adhere to those standards. If not, they’ll just be paying fines for noncompliance. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation last month said automakers would face more than $14 billion in noncompliance penalties between 2027 and 2032 under the proposed standards. Toyota on Tuesday said those fines are proof that the standards are not technologically feasible. Most other automakers have called the NHTSA’s proposals unreasonable and have requested revisions. They almost certainly couldn’t stomach the more radical standards Tesla is proposing. The American Automotive Policy Council, a group that represents the Detroit Three automakers (GM, Ford and Stellantis), urged the NHTSA to halve its proposed fuel economy increases to 2% for trucks, claiming the proposal would “disproportionately impact the truck fleet.” The organization said 83% of the vehicles produced by Ford, GM and Stellantis are trucks. Once again, Tesla would be safe here. The EV automaker began initial delivery of its electric Semi truck in December 2022, and in January announced a $3.6 billion expansion to its Nevada gigafactory in large part to scale manufacturing of the Class 8 truck. Earlier this year, the Department of Energy also proposed to revise how it calculates petroleum-equivalent fuel economy ratings for EVs in the CAFE program, something that the Zero Emission Transportation Association, a coalition of companies advocating for 100% EV sales, has backed. Yet automakers have said that revision would devalue the fuel economy of EVs by 72%.\", \"date\": \"Sun, 29 Oct 2023 00:00:00 GMT\", \"link\": \"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/10\/17\/tesla-looks-to-maintain-ev-dominance-by-pushing-for-stricter-fuel-standards\/\", \"source\": \"techcrunch\", \"title\": \"Tesla looks to maintain EV dominance by pushing for stricter fuel standards\"}"},

This is a significant increase from the NHTSA’s current proposal of 2% for cars and 4% for trucks and SUVs, aimed at achieving a fleet average of 58 miles per gallon by 2032.

They have already asked regulators for more lenient standards, especially since they are currently grappling with a costly union strike, estimated at $3.45 billion in losses, which could impact their electric vehicle (EV) rollouts. The strike and premium pricing of their EVs may also be contributing to a decrease in demand. \n Tesla’s own situation is somewhat different; the company's workforce is non-unionized and solely produces EVs, positioning it to benefit from both the ongoing strikes at other automakers and stricter fuel economy standards. Despite delivering a record number of vehicles and reducing car prices to boost sales, Tesla's market share has declined by 10 points since the previous year. Tesla claims that the NHTSA’s models do not fully account for current and anticipated market penetration of EVs, pointing to substantial investments in North American EV and battery production by various manufacturers and predicting that a third of new cars registered commercially could be electric by 2024. \n The automaker has criticized the NHTSA’s omission of future vehicle models like the Cybertruck in its modeling, asserting the production feasibility of the heavy-duty pickup truck by 2024. Moreover, Tesla opposes 'off-cycle credits,' which they believe favor internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, arguing for the complete removal of such credits to prevent dilution of emission standards and to direct research and investment towards electrification. \n Other automakers have labeled the NHTSA's proposed standards as technologically unrealistic, with Toyota citing the potential noncompliance fines as evidence. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation highlighted that automakers might face over $14 billion in penalties under the current proposals. The American Automotive Policy Council, representing Detroit's big three automakers, has pushed for halving the proposed increases for trucks, noting the heavy reliance of their production on truck models. \n Tesla's stance highlights its confidence in electric technology and positions the company to leverage regulatory changes for competitive advantage, while also advocating for policies that could accelerate the shift towards a lower-emission future. However, the feasibility of such stringent standards remains contentious among other industry players, who argue for more gradual transitions.\",\"date\": \"Sun, 29 Oct 2023\", \"link\": \"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/10\/17\/tesla-looks-to-maintain-ev-dominance-by-pushing-for-stricter-fuel-standards\/\",\"source\": \"techcrunch\",\"title\": \"Tesla Advocates for Tougher Fuel Standards to Bolster EV Leadership\"}"}
